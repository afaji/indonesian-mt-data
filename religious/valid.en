Driving a huge truck over the icy roads of northern Alaska would seem to be a task that requires a sense of humor
But when one driver heard another driver named Alex laugh often and rather loudly over the truck-to-truck communication system, he grew irritated
So he made some disparaging remarks about Alex and his good-natured guffaws
Not long after that, the critical driver lost control of his big rig and ended up in a ditch, up to his axles in snow
And guess who came along the isolated road and saw his predicament
Keep on trucking right past with a hearty laugh at the other guy's trouble
That's not what Alex did
He stopped and spent several hours helping dig his critic out
When he was done, he simply said, 'Any opportunity I can have to make amends, I'm happy to do it.'
And then, of course, he laughed
What a lesson for all of us
Isn't that what Christ commanded us to do in Luke 6, to help out even those who seem to be our enemies
The next time someone says something about you that you don't like, think of Alex, and don't just laugh it off
Do something positive for that person, and in so doing, you may make a friend.
Happy New Year
Looking forward to what this new year might bring, I can't help but wonder if 2012 will be the year when Jesus comes back
But then I also wonder if I'm ready
All of my life I've had to 'be ready.'
As a child, I had to be ready for dinner by washing my hands
As an adult, being ready for important responsibilities continues to be an ongoing reality
But I've come to realize that nothing is more important than being ready for our reunion with Jesus
Speaking of Christ's return, John tells us that 'everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself'
Looking forward to Jesus' return fills us with hope, not a wish-list kind of hope, but a solid expectation that motivates us to keep our hearts from sinful distractions and rivets our attention on becoming more like Him
If we really believe that this might be the year of His return, we will be more ready to forgive, to seek forgiveness, and to share God's unconditional love with others
As we consider the possibility that Jesus could return this year, let's be sure that we are ready
Let's strive to be pure as He is pure, anticipating the day when tears and sorrow, pain and death will all be replaced with the everlasting joy of His presence.
Not long ago, I passed a milestone marking 20 years since I began keeping a spiritual journal
As I reread my first few entries, I was amazed I ever kept it up
But now you couldn't pay me to stop
Here are some benefits I have received from journaling: From life experiences, I see that progress and failure are both part of the journey
I'm reminded of God's grace when I read how He helped me to find a solution to a major problem
I gain insight from past struggles that help with issues I am currently facing
And, most important, journaling shows me how God has been faithfully working in my life
Many of the psalms are like a spiritual journal
They often record how God has helped in times of testing
In Psalm 40, David writes: 'I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry
He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps'
Later, David needed only to read that psalm to be reminded of God's faithful deliverance
Journaling may be useful to you too
It can help you see more clearly what God is teaching you on life's journey and cause you to reflect on God's faithfulness.
For the past several years, my daughter Rosie has been the director of drama at a local middle school
Students come to audition and a few are selected to play the lead roles
But there are still many other important supporting roles that must be cast, roles that are vital to the production
There are other young people who want to be a part of the show but don't relish being in the spotlight
They are the ones who will change scenery, open and close the curtains, run the lights, and assist with makeup and costume changes
Then there are the parents from the community who provide pizza and cookies for rehearsals, donate goods, build sets, sew costumes, make signs, and hand out programs
The success of the performances are the culmination of an intense 4- to 5-month process that is dependent on the hard work of a wide range of dedicated volunteers
Similarly, for the body of Christ to function fully, each of us must play a part
Every believer is uniquely gifted for service
When these gifts are combined in a cooperative relationship, 'every part does its share'
and the separate parts make up the whole
We need each other
What part are you playing in the life of the church?
Life in our world can be difficult
At some point, most of us have wondered, Where is God in my trouble
And we may have thought, It seems like injustice is winning and God is silent
We have a choice as to how we respond to our troubles
The prophet Habakkuk had an attitude worth following: He made the choice to rejoice
Habakkuk saw the rapid increase in Judah's moral and spiritual failings, and this disturbed him deeply
But God's response troubled him even more
God would use the wicked nation of Babylon to punish Judah
Habakkuk did not fully understand this, but he could rejoice because he had learned to rely on the wisdom, justice, and sovereignty of God
He concluded his book with a wonderful affirmation: 'Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation'
Though it was not clear how Judah would survive, Habakkuk had learned to trust God amid injustice, suffering, and loss
He would live by his faith in God alone
With this kind of faith came joy in God, despite the circumstances surrounding him
We too can rejoice in our trials, have surefooted confidence in God, and live on the heights of His sovereignty.
In the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, England, the devastation of generations of enslaved men, women, and children is remembered
The price innocent people have paid for the greed of others is horrific, but theirs is not the only cost
Engraved in a wall of the museum is a profound observation made by Frederick Douglass, former slave and crusader for human rights, which reads, 'No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck.'
In the act of dehumanizing others, we dehumanize ourselves
The apostle Paul put it another way when he wrote, 'Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap'
Paul's words form a stark reminder to us that our choices have consequences, and that includes how we choose to treat others
When we choose to hate, that hate can return to us in the form of consequences that we can never fully prepare for
We can find ourselves alienated from others, angry with ourselves, and hamstrung in our ability to serve Christ effectively
Instead, let's choose 'not [to] grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap
As we have opportunity, let us do good to all'
Roger lost his job due to the company being downsized
For months he searched, applied for jobs, prayed, asked others to pray, and trusted God
Roger and his wife Jerrie's emotions fluctuated though
They saw God provide for them in unexpected ways and experienced His grace, but sometimes they worried that a job would never come
For 15 long months, they waited
Then Roger had three interviews with a company, and a week later the employment agency called and said, 'Have you heard the saying,
Well, you've got the job!'
Jerrie told me later, 'We wouldn't trade this hard experience for anything
It brought us closer together and closer to the Lord.'
Friends who had prayed rejoiced and gave thanks to God
Paul wanted the Corinthian church to see the grace of God at work in his life, which could cause 'thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God'
His trials were so severe that he was hard pressed on every side,'perplexed,'persecuted,' and 'struck down'
Yet he encouraged the people not to lose heart in troubles but to trust God
During our difficulties, we can be drawn nearer to God and others, as Roger and Jerrie experienced, and praise will go to the Lord for His grace.
If you really want to get folks upset, threaten their economy
A bad economic picture gets politicians voted out of office, and the threat of a downturn nearly got the apostle Paul kicked out of Ephesus
Here's what happened
Paul came to town and started 'reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God'
For more than 2 years he shared the gospel, and many began following Jesus
Because Paul was so successful in getting people to see that there is only one true God, many Ephesians stopped worshiping the goddess Diana
This was bad news for the local silversmiths, who made their living creating and selling Diana statuettes
If enough people stopped believing in her, business would dry up
A commotion and an uproar broke out when the craftsmen figured this out
This Ephesus incident can remind us to evaluate our reasons for worshiping God
The silversmiths wanted to protect their worship as a way of protecting their prosperity, 
may that never be said of us
Don't ever let your worship of God become an avenue to good fortune
We worship God because of His love for us and because of who He is, not because loving Him can help our bottom line
Let's worship God the right way.
During our church's Christmas celebration, I watched the choir members assemble in front of the congregation while the music director rifled through papers on a slim black stand
The instruments began, and the singers launched into a well-known song that started with these words: 'Come, now is the time to worship.'
Although I expected to hear a time-honored Christmas carol, I smiled at the appropriate choice of music
Earlier that week I had been reading Luke's account of Jesus' birth, and I noticed that the first Christmas lacked our modern-day parties, gifts, and feasting, but it did include worship
After the angel announced Jesus' birth to some wide-eyed shepherds, a chorus of angels began 'praising God and saying: '\sGlory to God in the highest!''
The shepherds responded by running to Bethlehem where they found the newborn King lying in a barnyard bassinet
They returned to their fields 'glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen'
Coming face to face with the Son inspired the shepherds to worship the Father
Today, consider your response to Jesus' arrival on earth
Is there room for worship in your heart on this day that celebrates His birth?
Medical researchers are working tirelessly to find a cure for cancer, a clue to the mystery of Alzheimer's, and ways to conquer a host of other debilitating diseases
But what if you awoke to headlines saying DEATH DESTROYED
Would you believe it
Could you believe it
The New Testament proclaims that for the believer in Christ, death has been destroyed, reduced to inactivity, rendered incapable of doing what it once did
'So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory''
This good news is for everyone who will receive it, just as the angel told the shepherds when Jesus was born, 'Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people
For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord'
The birth of Jesus was the beginning of the end for death
'The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ'
That is why we celebrate Christmas!
Pastor Tim Keller of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan rightly observes that Christianity is unique among all religions for it is about God's pursuit of us to draw us to Himself
In every other religious system, people pursue their god, hoping that through good behavior, keeping of rituals, good works, or other efforts they will be accepted by the god they pursue
The British poet Francis Thompson catches the profound nature of this reality when he writes of the relentless pursuit of God in his life
In his work titled 'The Hound of Heaven,'
he writes that as he fled from God he couldn't outrun 'those strong feet that followed
with unhurrying chase and unperturbed pace.'
But God's untiring pursuit of the wayward is not just Thompson's story
At the heart of the Christmas message is the wonderful truth of God's pursuit of every one of us
As Paul affirms, 'God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law'
And it's not just the Christmas story
It's the story of God's pursuit of Adam and Eve after the fall
His pursuit of me
His pursuit of you
Where would we be today if God weren't the 'Hound of Heaven'??
A British treasure hunter discovered a huge stash of Roman coins buried in a field in southwest England
Using a metal detector, Dave Crisp located a large pot holding 52,000 coins
These ancient silver and bronze coins, which date from the third century AD and weigh more than 350 pounds, are valued at $5 million
While Crisp's treasure may cause us to dream about somehow finding similar riches, we as Christians should be on a different kind of treasure hunt
What we seek does not consist of silver and gold
Rather our quest is to gather the precious gems of insight so that we might gain the 'full assurance of understanding
, both of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge'
The hidden treasure of knowing the Lord more completely is found in the Bible
The psalmist said, 'I rejoice at Your Word as one who finds great treasure'
If we read the Word of God hurriedly or carelessly, we will miss its deep insights
These truths must be sought earnestly with all the attention of someone seeking hidden treasure
Are you eager to find the treasures stored in Scripture
Start digging!
In the early hours of December 21, 2010, I witnessed an event that last occurred in 1638, a total lunar eclipse on the winter solstice
Slowly the shadow of the earth slipped across the bright full moon and made it appear a dark red
It was a remarkable and beautiful event
Yet it reminded me that while physical darkness is part of God's created design, spiritual darkness is not
Scottish pastor Alexander MacLaren said: 'Rejected light is the parent of the densest darkness, and the man who, having the light, does not trust it, piles around himself thick clouds of obscurity and gloom.'
Jesus described this self-imposed spiritual eclipse of heart and mind when He said, 'If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!'
The great invitation of Christmas is to open our hearts to the Savior who came to end our darkness
Jesus said, 'While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness'
The way out of our spiritual night is to walk in the light with Him.
As my kids were discarding their trash at the local mall food court, my oldest son was almost run into by a man who was clearly on a mission
My younger son jokingly remarked, 'Maybe he stole something.'
Thinking I might be able to use this as a teachable moment, I said, 'That's what the Bible calls judging.'
He then asked with a smile: 'Why are you always '\spastoring' me?'
After I finished laughing, I told my sons that I could never take a vacation from shepherding them
The apostle Paul told the Ephesian elders that they too could never take a vacation from shepherding God's people
He was convinced that false teachers would try to ravage the church , and the elders needed to protect the group from them
Caring for God's people includes feeding them spiritually, leading them gently, and warning them firmly
Leaders in the church are to be motivated by the incalculable price Christ paid on the cross
Church leaders have a big responsibility to watch over our souls, for one day they will give an account to the Lord for their work among us
Let's bring them joy now by responding to their faithful, godly leadership with obedience and submission .
Recently, my husband and I were reacquainted with a young man we had known as a child many years ago
We fondly reminisced about a Christmas program when Matthew had sung, in a perfect boy soprano, the song 'All Is Well' by Wayne Kirkpatrick and Michael W Smith
It was a wonderful memory of a song beautifully sung
All is well, all is well;  Lift up your voice and sing
Born is now Emmanuel,  Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia, all is well
To hear the words of that song at Christmastime is comforting to many
But some people are unable to absorb the message because their lives are in turmoil
They've experienced the loss of a loved one, persistent unemployment, a serious illness, or depression that will not go away
Their hearts loudly cry out, 'All is not well' not for me!'
But for those of us who celebrate the birth of our Savior, despite the dark night of the soul we may experience' all is well because of Christ
We are not alone in our pain
God is beside us and promises never to leave
He promises that His grace will be sufficient
He promises to supply all our needs
And He promises us the amazing gift of eternal life
As we review God's promises, we can agree with the poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who wrote, 'Before me, even as behind, God is, and all is well.'?
How far is it from Nazareth to Bethlehem
If you're in Pennsylvania, it's about 9 miles and takes about 10 minutes by car
But if you're in Nazareth of Galilee, and you're traveling along with your pregnant wife, as Joseph was, it's about 80 miles to Bethlehem
That journey probably took Joseph and Mary about a week, and they didn't stay in a nice hotel when they got there
All Joseph could find was a stall in a stable, and that's where Mary delivered 'her firstborn Son'
But the journey for the infant Jesus was much farther than 80 miles
He left His place in heaven at God's right hand, came to earth, and accepted our humanity
Eventually, He was stretched out on a cross to die, and He was buried in a borrowed tomb
But the journey was not over
He conquered death, left the tomb, walked again among men, and ascended to heaven
Even that is not the journey's end
Someday He will return as King of kings and Lord of lords
As you take a Christmas journey this month, reflect on the journey Jesus made for us
He came from heaven to earth to die for us, making salvation available through His death on the cross and His glorious resurrection
Praise God for that first Christmas journey!
As we drove home from a Christmas party one evening, my family and I approached a small country church nestled between glittering snowbanks
From a distance, I could see its holiday display
Strings of white lights formed the capital letters: H-O-P-E
The sight of that word shining in the darkness reminded me that Jesus is, and always has been, the hope of humankind
Before Jesus was born, people hoped for the Messiah	the One who would shoulder their sin and intercede with God on their behalf
They expected the Messiah to arrive through a virgin who would bear a son in Bethlehem and would name Him Immanuel, 'God with us'
The night Jesus was born, their hope was fulfilled
Although we're no longer waiting for Jesus in the form of an infant, He is still the source of our hope
We watch for His second coming ; we anticipate the heavenly home He is preparing for us ; and we dream of living with Him in His celestial city
As Christians, we can look forward to the future because the baby in the manger was, and still is, 'the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope'
Ah, the life of a pig
Each new day brings nothing but slopping through the mud and snorting happily at mealtime
And what meals they have
Crunchy corn husks or whatever leftovers get tossed into the pen
It probably didn't sound good to the prodigal son either
Before he started eating with pigs, he had a warm bed, a rich inheritance, a loving father, a secure future, and probably good food
But it wasn't enough
He wanted 'fun'
He wanted to run his own life and do whatever he desired
It resulted in a pig's dinner
Whenever a young person ignores the guidance of godly parents and the instruction of God's Word, similar results occur
It always shocks me when someone who professes to know Jesus chooses a life that rejects God's clear teaching
Whether the choices include sexual sin, addictive substances, a lack of ambition, or something else, any action that leaves God out risks ending badly
If we ignore clear biblical morals and neglect our relationship with God, we can expect trouble
Luke tells us that the young man turned things around after he came to his senses
Keep your senses about you
Live for God by the guidance of His Word' unless you have a hankering for the husks.
After the American TV personality Ed McMahon died in 2009, one newspaper headline read, 'When it came to being the No 2 man, he was No 1.'
Best known for his 30-year tenure as Johnny Carson's late-night sidekick
McMahon excelled at helping Carson succeed in the spotlight
While most entertainers strive for top billing, McMahon was content with a supporting role
When the apostle Paul gave instructions about how to exercise our gifts as members of the body of Christ , he affirmed the value of supporting roles
He began by saying that we should have a realistic opinion of ourselves , and he concluded with a call to genuine, unselfish love: 'Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another'
JB Phillips translates it, 'a willingness to let the other man have the credit.'
Our gifts and abilities come to us by God's grace and are to be used by faith in love and service for Christ, not for personal recognition
May God grant us the ability to embrace with enthusiasm the supporting roles to which He calls us
The ultimate goal is His glory and not our own.
When I was about 5 years old, my father decided that I needed a horse of my own to care for
So he bought an old bay mare and brought her home to me
I named her Dixie
Dixie was a formidable beast for me at my age and small stature
No saddle was small enough, no stirrups short enough for my legs, so I rode bareback most of the time
Dixie was plump, which meant that my feet stuck straight out, making it difficult to stay astride
But whenever I fell off, Dixie would simply stop, look at me, and wait while I tried to climb on her back again
This leads me to Dixie's most admirable trait: She was wonderfully patient
I, on the other hand, was less than patient with Dixie
Yet she bore my childish tantrums with stoic patience, never once retaliating
I wish I could be more like Dixie, having patience that overlooks a multitude of offenses
I have to ask myself, 'How do I react when others aggravate me?'
Do I respond with humility, meekness, and patience
Or with intolerance and indignation
To overlook an offense
To forgive 70 times 7
To bear with human frailty and failure
To show mercy and kindness to those who exasperate us
To gain such control over our souls, this is the work of God.
Money is tight when you're a college student
So when free food is available, students will show up anytime, anywhere
If a company wants to recruit new employees, it will entice young people on college campuses to come to a presentation by offering free pizza
Some students attend presentation after presentation, just for the pizza
The food in the present seems to be more important than the job for the future
Jesus fed a crowd of 5,000, and the next day many searched for Him
He challenged them: 'You seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled'
It seems that the food was more important to some of the people than the everlasting life Jesus offered in Himself
He told them He was 'the bread of God who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world'
Some didn't believe, wouldn't accept His teaching, and 'walked with Him no more'
They had wanted the food, but they didn't want Him and what would be required of them to follow Him
Jesus calls us today to come to Him, not for the blessings from His hand but to receive the eternal life He offers and to follow Him, 'the bread of God.'?
On a recent trip, the flight attendant asked if I flew very often
When I said I did, he asked, 'Have you noticed people on planes becoming increasingly more belligerent and aggressive in recent months?'
I had to confess that I agreed with him
We began talking about what might be contributing to it, things like increased airport security, higher costs, fewer services, and a general dissatisfaction with travel
As if to prove the point, our conversation was interrupted by a passenger who refused to sit in his assigned seat because he liked someone else's seat assignment better
When we encounter anger and belligerence, the follower of Christ can be a peacemaker
Paul wrote to the church at Rome with this challenge, 'If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men'
What does that mean
For one thing, it means that we must control what we can control
We can't control the attitudes of others, but we can control our response
When we see angry or hostile attitudes displayed around us, we can show the heart of the Prince of Peace by responding graciously in a peaceful manner
In this way we will demonstrate the attitude of our Savior in a world filled with a growing belligerence.
A popular slogan says, 'Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.'
I see the phrase everywhere, on everything from T-shirts to pieces of art
It's a catchy phrase, but I think it's misleading
If we measure life by breathtaking moments, we miss the wonder of ordinary moments
Eating, sleeping, and breathing seem 'ordinary'
in that we do them every day, usually without much thought
But they are not ordinary at all
Every bite and every breath are miracles
In fact, having breath is more miraculous than anything that takes our breath away
King Solomon may have had more breathtaking moments than anyone
He said, 'I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure'
But he expressed cynicism about it by saying, 'All of it is meaningless'
Solomon's life reminds us that it's important to find joy in 'ordinary' things, for they are indeed wonderful
Bigger is not always better
More is not always an improvement
Busier doesn't make us more important
Rather than look for meaning in breathtaking moments, we should find meaning in every breath we take, and make every breath meaningful.
On some of the Christmas cards you will receive this year, no doubt there will be a man standing in the background looking over the shoulder of Mary, who is prominently displayed caring for the baby Jesus
His name is Joseph
And after the nativity narratives, he isn't heard from much again
If we didn't know better, we would think Joseph was an insignificant bystander or, at best, a mere necessity to undergird Jesus' claim to the throne of David
But, in fact, the role that Joseph played was strategically important
If he had disobeyed the angel's command to take Mary as his wife , he would have, from a human perspective, put the entire mission of Jesus at risk
Taking Mary as his wife was a risky assignment
Public perception that he was the baby's father put him in serious violation of Jewish law and made him a public disgrace
Yet today all of us are thankful that he was willing to risk his reputation to participate in and facilitate God's unfolding drama
Most of us are insignificant compared to the major players in this world
But all of us are called to obey
Who knows what God has in store when we are willing to surrender to God's will, even when it puts us at risk!
I've been told that 'three-wish stories'
occur in almost every culture, all following a similar theme: A benefactor appears and offers to grant three wishes to an unsuspecting beneficiary
The fact that the stories so often occur suggests we all want something we cannot get on our own
There's even a 'wish story' in the Bible
It happened one night when the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said to him, 'Ask what shall I give you?'
Solomon could have asked for anything'riches, honor, fame, or power
But he asked for none of these things
He requested 'an understanding heart'
or a 'hearing heart,' a humble heart to listen and learn from God's Word
The young, inexperienced king, weighed down with the responsibilities of ruling a vast nation, needed the Lord's wisdom to govern well
Am I that wise
If God spoke to me directly and asked what He could do for me, what would I ask for
Would I ask for health, wealth, youth, power, or prestige
Or would I ask for wisdom, holiness, and love
Would I be wise or foolish
Suppose God asked you what He could give to you, what would you ask for?
In The Weight of Glory, CS Lewis tells the story of a woman who gave birth to a son while confined as a prisoner in a dungeon
Since the boy had never seen the outside world, his mother tried to describe it by making pencil drawings
Later when he and his mother were released from prison, the simple pencil sketches were replaced by the actual images of our beautiful world
In a similar way, the inspired picture the Bible gives us of heaven will someday be replaced by joyful, direct experience
Paul understood that our perception of heaven is limited until one day in the future when we will be in Christ's presence
'Now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known'
Yet Paul's confidence in future glory gave him strength in the midst of trial: 'I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us'
Our current idea of the glories of heaven is only a simple sketch
But we can be completely confident in Jesus' claim that He has gone to prepare a place for us
The best is yet to come!
When a US Navy vessel arrives or departs from the military bases in Pearl Harbor, the crew of that ship lines up in dress uniform
They stand at attention at arm's length on the outer edges of the deck, in salute to the soldiers, sailors, and civilians who died on December 7, 1941
It is a stirring sight, and participants often list it among the most memorable moments of their military career
Even for spectators on shore, the salute triggers an incredible emotional connection, but especially between the servants of today and the servants of yesterday
It grants nobility to the work of today's sailor, while giving dignity to the sacrifice of those from the past
When Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper , it was surely with an eye toward creating this same kind of emotional bond
Our participation in the Lord's Table honors His sacrifice while also granting us a connection to Him unlike any other act of remembrance
Just as the Navy carefully prescribes the way it salutes the fallen, so too Scripture teaches us how to remember Jesus' sacrifice
These acts of reverence and thanksgiving serve to honor past action while giving purpose to present service.
Does it bother you to see how much attention is paid in today's culture to people who stand for all the wrong things
Perhaps it is entertainment stars who get the headlines while espousing immoral philosophies in their music, movies, or programs
Or it could be leaders who openly thumb their noses at right-living standards
It would be easy to fret about this and wring our hands in despair, but Psalm 37 suggests a better way
Listen to David's wise advice: 'Do not fret because of evildoers, nor be envious of the workers of iniquity'
While it is right to be 'salt and light'
in this tasteless, dark world, attempting to counter sin by reflecting Jesus' light wherever possible, we cannot let negative forces cause us to live in anger and wrath
Instead, we must rely on God to have the ultimate say about evildoers: 'They shall soon be cut down like the grass'
Beyond that, we should take David's approach: 'Trust in the Lord, and do good.'
'Feed on His faithfulness.'
'Delight yourself also in the Lord.'
'Commit your way to the Lord.'
'Rest in the Lord'
We may not like what we see and hear from some aspects of society, but remember this: God is in control
Trust Him to do what is right
And don't fret.
A friend described his grandmother as one of the greatest influences in his life
Throughout his adult years, he has kept her portrait next to his desk to remind himself of her unconditional love
'I really do believe,'
he said, 'that she helped me learn how to love.'
Not everyone has had a similar taste of human love, but through Christ each of us can experience being well-loved by God
In 1 John 4, the word love occurs 27 times, and God's love through Christ is cited as the source of our love for God and for others
'In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins'
'We have known and believed the love that God has for us'
'We love Him because He first loved us'
God's love is not a slowly dripping faucet or a well we must dig for ourselves
It is a rushing stream that flows from His heart into ours
Whatever our family background or experiences in life, whether we feel well-loved by others or not, we can know love
We can draw from the Lord's inexhaustible source to know His loving care for us, and we can pass it on to others
In Christ our Savior, we are well-loved.
In the days of Adam and Eve, peace was lost
As soon as they ate the forbidden fruit and realized their nakedness, they started blaming each other and introduced conflict to God's peaceful planet
Sadly, all of their descendants, including us, have followed their bad example
We blame others for our own bad choices and become angry when no one will accept the guilt
Blaming others for our unhappiness breaks apart families, churches, communities, and nations
We can't make peace because we're preoccupied with placing the blame
Christmas is the season of peace
The Old Testament tells the story of how God set the stage to introduce the Prince of Peace
Jesus came to break the cycle of sin and blame by making peace for us with God 'through the blood of His cross'
Instead of blaming us for all the trouble we cause, He bore the blame for all of us
He is now recruiting followers who, having received His forgiveness, want others to receive it as well
When we accept forgiveness from God, we lose our desire to withhold it from others
And when we live in peace with God, we are eager to make peace with others
We can both give and receive the gift of peace this Christmas.
When our kids were young, my wife Martie and I enjoyed family vacations in Florida visiting our parents
It was especially wonderful to be there in the warmth for a brief respite from the Michigan wind-chill factor
I couldn't wait to just relax on the beach with a good book
But my kids had other ideas
They wanted my help building sandcastles
Reluctantly, I'd get up to help, only to be quickly consumed by the project at hand
Before I knew it, I had spent hours creating an impressive castle, not thinking that it was only a matter of time until the tide would wash away all my hard work
We often make the same mistake in life, spending lots of time and energy building our own little 'castles'
of stuff and basking in our accomplishments
It all may seem worthwhile, but in the end it's worthless
In Luke 12, Jesus challenged His followers to sell their possessions and give to the poor, 'For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also'
In other words, the way we spend our time and resources says a lot about our eternal perspective
As the old hymn goes, 'Only one life, 'twill soon be past; only what's done for Christ will last.'
So what have you done today that will last for eternity?
College students rent a house from my sister and her husband
One night, a thief attempted to break in
When the young woman living there called the police to tell them that a break-in was in progress, the operator responded in an unusual way: 'You'll have to call back in the morning
We're just too busy right now.'
That response was very disturbing
The young woman had done the right thing by calling the police, but for some reason her plea for help was disregarded
That kind of indifference is upsetting
But indifference never happens when we go to God in prayer
We may not always feel that God is listening, but He is
He cares, and He will respond
The Bible reminds us that we can take comfort in the fact that our God is deeply concerned with what concerns our hearts: 'The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth'
When we call out to Him, we will never get a disinterested response
Rather than distancing Himself from us when we cry to Him, our heavenly Father draws close to us in our time of need
He is never too busy for His child's prayers, He hears us when we call.
I believe that all Scripture is related and all Scripture is relevant
Nevertheless, I was surprised when my November reading in the book of 1\sPeter touched on all four themes of Advent' 
that period of time on the church calendar when many Christians prepare to celebrate the first coming of Christ while looking forward to His second coming
During Advent, we emphasize hope, peace, joy, and love, which God sent with Christ
HOPE
We have an inheritance reserved in heaven, a living hope through the resurrection of Christ from the dead
PEACE
We will love life and see good days if we turn from evil and do good and if we seek peace, for the Lord watches over the righteous and hears their prayers
JOY
We have inexpressible joy even though we have trials because our faith is being tested and proven genuine
The end of this faith is the salvation of our souls
LOVE
We can love one another with a pure heart because we have been born again through the Word of God which lives and abides forever
Because Christ came the first time, we can live with hope, peace, joy, and love till He comes again.
On November 24, 1971, a man known today as DB Cooper hijacked a commercial flight between Portland and Seattle by threatening to blow up the plane unless he received $200,000
After landing to receive a ransom, he ordered the plane back into the air
Then the rear stairs of the 727 aircraft were lowered, and he parachuted into the night
He was never captured, and the case is still unsolved
This act hastened the age of airport security in which trust and confidence have been replaced by suspicion and fear
What he did affected us all
The Bible describes two actions that changed the world in a far more significant way
Through Adam's choice, sin and death entered the world, 'and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned'
But through Christ's sacrifice on the cross, God provided a remedy for the results of sin
'Through one man's [Adam's] offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man's [Christ's] righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life'
Christ did what no one else could do when He broke the power of sin and death by His resurrection
He offers forgiveness and eternal life to all who will accept His gift
And for that, we thank Him with all our hearts.
My dad recently turned 90 years old and his physical capabilities are fading
He can still move around with his walker, but he needs someone to cook his meals and help him with other tasks
My older brother Steve and his wife Judy lived close to him, so they decided to move in with Dad to care for him
Wanting to help in some way, my wife and I flew across the country to help out a bit by watching Dad while my brother and his wife had some time away together
We enjoyed our time with my father and were glad to ease Steve and Judy's load, even if it was only for a few days
The Bible says to 'honor your father and mother'
One New Testament commentary says that to honor someone is to 'treat him with the deference, respect, reverence, kindness, courtesy, and obedience which his station in life demands.'
For young children, this means obeying parents
For teenagers, it indicates showing respect for Mom and Dad even if you think you know more than they do
For young adults, this means including your parents in your life
And for those in middle-age and beyond, it means making sure that parents are cared for as they move into old age or their health declines
How can you honor your parents this week?
On a trip out of the country, I happened to meet an attorney who was from my hometown in New Jersey
We were surprised at how much we had in common
In the course of the conversation, he asked, 'Did you say your name was Stillwell?'
I said, 'No, it's Stowell.'
He then mentioned that he had a client named Stillwell
'Is it Art Stillwell?'
I asked, and, to my surprise, he said yes
Art Stillwell attended my church and was an influential businessman in the community
The attorney admitted that he had no client quite like Art
He explained that most of his clients want him to do whatever it takes to get them out of their problems, but Art was different
Whenever he asked Art what to do in any given situation, Art always replied, 'Just do what's right!'
Obviously it had made an impression on the attorney
Yielding to Christ in all of our desires and decisions regardless of the outcome is what sets us apart in a world full of people consumed by their own interests
When we live blameless lives 'without fault'?, courageously reflecting the integrity, love, and grace of Jesus, we clearly 'shine as lights in the world'
So, if you want to light up your world in a compelling way, just do what's right!
In one way or another, we can all relate to Psalm 86:1 where David says, 'I am poor and needy.'
Even the richest among us should understand that poverty and need relate more to the spirit than to the wallet
When billionaire Rich DeVos speaks to groups he often says, 'I'm just a sinner saved by grace.'
Psalm 86 tells us that the help God provides is not measured by a monetary ledger sheet
When we acknowledge that we are poor and needy, it's not so God will lavish material riches on us
No, we do so to open the door to other, more valuable treasures
Here's what God does for the poor and needy
He will preserve our lives and save all those who trust in Him
He will be merciful and ready to forgive
He will listen to and answer prayer
But we're not to take God's blessings without giving back
We have a responsibility to learn God's ways, walk in His truth, 'fear [God's] name,'
praise the Lord, and 'glorify [His] name'
Do you consider yourself among the 'poor and needy'?
If so, welcome to the club
Let's not forget all the spiritual blessings God has for us and the godly response we should have toward His generosity.
Artist and scientist Michael Flynn designed a singing bowl for display in ArtPrize, an international art competition held in Grand Rapids, Michigan
The bowl requires no electricity but it does require something that is in short supply: cooperation
As I observed people trying to make the bowl sing, I was surprised that none of them bothered to read the directions about rocking it gently
Instead, impatient to make music, they kept trying their own ideas
After a few minutes they walked away frustrated and disappointed, as if the bowl was defective
How many times, I wonder, do we become frustrated that life isn't working the way we think it should
We keep trying ways that seem right, but things keep turning out wrong
Instead of following God's Word, we continue trying to find our own way
The singing bowl reminds us that we can't expect life to go well if we ignore the instructions of the Designer
Failing to obey divides us from one another and separates us from God
To fulfill His plan for the world and make the way of salvation known , we need to follow His instructions about living and working peacefully together
When life doesn't go well, it may be that we've stopped following God's plan.
A study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota found that almost 15 percent of American teenagers felt it was 'highly likely'
that they would die before their 35th birthday
Those with this pessimistic outlook were more likely to engage in reckless behavior
Dr Iris Borowsky, author of the study published in Pediatrics magazine, said: 'These youth may take risks because they feel hopeless and figure that not much is at stake.'
No one is immune to feelings of despair
The Psalms express repeated pleas for help when life seems dark
'Why are you in despair, O my soul and why have you become disturbed within me
Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him for the help of His presence'
In a defiant step of faith, the psalmist tells himself not to forget about God, who will never forsake him
Curtis Almquist has written: 'Hope is fueled by the presence of God
[It] is also fueled by the future of God in our lives.'
We can say with the psalmist, 'I shall yet praise Him'
No follower of Christ should feel reluctant to seek counsel for depression
Nor should we feel that faith and prayer are too simplistic to help
There is always hope in God
Each year at the end of November, the President of the United States issues an official pardon for the National Thanksgiving Turkey
During this lighthearted ceremony, one president remarked: 'Our guest of honor looks a little nervous
Nobody's told him yet that I'm going to give him a pardon.'
The poor turkey had a good reason to be uneasy, without an acquittal, he was doomed to be Thanksgiving dinner
We are in a similar situation when it comes to our sin
Without God's pardon, we're on our way to certain demise
This condition is a direct result of our own wrongdoing
The Bible says, 'The wages of sin is death'
However, we can be set free from this death sentence because God's Son bore our sin in His body on the cross, 'that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness
by whose stripes you were healed.'
First John 1:7 tells us that Jesus' blood 'cleanses us from all sin.'
We can accept God's pardon for our sin and receive eternal life when we confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead
Today, consider how you will respond to God's offer of forgiveness.
My cable company sent a postcard inviting me to check out its latest improvements in TV channels
The card indicated that I needed to contact the company to get the necessary new digital equipment and explained how to hook it up and activate it
After that, the ad said I was just to 'sit back and enjoy the World of More.'
The card made me think of the 'World of More'
that Christians are privileged to live in
When God transports people from the darkness of sin 'into His marvelous light'
a whole new life opens up
Romans 5 tells us some of the more that we have in Christ: We have been 'reconciled to God through the death of His Son'
and therefore have 'peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ'
We have access to God and His grace
Rejoicing in trouble is now possible because we understand that it's an opportunity to grow in our character through trusting Him
Additionally, the Holy Spirit, who has been given to live in us, pours the love of God into our hearts
And sin no longer has the same hold on us
As Christians, we have unlimited access to a real 'World of More.'
Wouldn't it be selfish not to invite others to join us in that special world?
The whole reason for saying thanks is to let the giver of a gift know how much you appreciate something
Author GB Stern once said, 'Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone.'
When our son was young, he sometimes needed to be reminded that avoiding eye contact, looking down at his feet, and mumbling some unintelligible words was not an acceptable 'thank you.'
And after many years of marriage, my husband and I are still learning that it's important for us to continually express our gratitude to each other
When one of us feels appreciative, we try to verbalize it, even if we've said it many times before about the same thing
William Arthur Ward said, 'Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.'
Showing our gratitude is obviously important in human relationships, but it's even more essential in our relationship with God
As we think about the many blessings we have received, do we express our thanks to Him throughout the day
And when we think of the amazing gift of His death and resurrection for forgiveness of our sins, do our hearts bubble over with awe and thanksgiving
Take the reminder in Psalm 107:1 to heart each day: 'Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!'?
I recently saw a documentary about the making of a Steinway piano
It traced the meticulous care that goes into crafting this fine instrument
From the cutting of trees until the piano appears on a showroom floor, it goes through countless delicate adjustments by skilled craftsmen
When the year-long process is complete, accomplished musicians play the piano and often comment on how the same rich sounds could never be produced by a computerized assembly line
The secret to the final product is the craftsman's touch
When the tabernacle was built, we see that God also valued the craftsman's touch
He chose the craftsman Bezalel and said of him: 'I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to design artistic works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in cutting jewels for setting, in carving wood'
Today God dwells in the hearts of believers
Yet the call to craftsmanship has not ended
Now each individual believer is God's 'workmanship'
The Master Craftsman is the Holy Spirit, who chips away at flaws in our character to make each of us like Jesus
And as we yield to His workmanship, we will find that the secret to the final product is the Craftsman's touch.
There's an old Sunday school song that periodically comes back to my mind
Its words testify to the blessing of the peace that Jesus so generously gives: 'I have the peace that passes understanding down in my heart, down in my heart to stay!'
There is something missing in that well-intentioned song, however
The peace of God is truly a gift we enjoy in our hearts as we fellowship in His presence
But He never intended for us to keep all of that peace to ourselves
Peace is a gift to be shared with those around us
As Christians, it should mark our relationships and characterize the environment of our churches
In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, 'Blessed are the peacemakers'
which indicates that we are to be intentional about bringing peace to our relationships
Since we are prone to be troublemakers instead of peacemakers, this is important advice
So, what does peacemaking look like
Peacemakers are those who turn the other cheek , go the extra mile , and love their enemies while praying for those who persecute them
Why should we do this
Because God is a peacemaker, and when we make peace we are 'called sons of God'
Peacemaking is a family trait.
God did some fall housecleaning this week
He sent a mighty wind through our neighborhood that made the trees tremble and shake loose their dead branches
When it finished, I had a mess to clean up
In my own life, God sometimes works in a similar way
He will send or allow stormy circumstances that shake loose the 'lifeless branches'
I've been refusing to release
Sometimes it's something that once was good, like an area of ministry, but is no longer bearing fruit
More often it's something that's not good, like a bad habit I've slid into or a stubborn attitude that prevents new growth
The Old Testament prophet Jonah discovered what can happen when one refuses to get rid of a stubborn attitude
His hatred for the Ninevites was stronger than his love for God, so God sent a great storm that landed Jonah in a giant fish
God preserved the reluctant prophet in that unlikely place and gave him a second chance to obey
The lifeless limbs in my yard caused me to think of attitudes that God expects me to dispose of
Paul's letter to the Ephesians lists some of them: bitterness, anger, and evil speech
When God shakes things up, we need to get rid of what He shakes loose.
Is it possible, in a society that seems increasingly indifferent to the gospel, to communicate the Good News to people who don't share our faith
One way to connect with people who are unfamiliar with the things of Christ is to become culturally 'bilingual.'
We do this by communicating in ways people can easily relate to
Knowing about and discussing music, film, sports, and television, for example, can offer just such an opportunity
If people hear us 'speak their language,' without endorsing or condoning the media or events we refer to, it could open the door to sharing the timeless message of Christ
Paul gave us an example of this in Acts 17
While visiting the Areopagus in Athens, he spoke to a thoroughly secular culture by quoting pagan Greek poets as a point of reference for the spiritual values he sought to communicate
He said, 'In Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, '\sFor we are also His offspring''
Just as Paul addressed that culture by knowing what they were reading, we may have greater impact for the gospel by relating it to people in terms they can readily embrace
Are you trying to reach a neighbor or a co-worker with the gospel
Try becoming bilingual.
I love to walk Idaho's paths and trails and enjoy its grandeur and picturesque beauty
I'm often reminded that these treks are symbolic of our spiritual journey, for the Christian life is simply walking, with Jesus alongside as our companion and guide
He walked through the land of Israel from one end to the other, gathering disciples, saying to them, 'Follow Me'
The journey is not always easy
Sometimes giving up seems easier than going on, but when things get difficult, we can rest a while and renew our strength
In Pilgrim's Progress, John Bunyan describes the arbor on Hill Difficulty where Christian caught his breath before continuing the climb
His scroll provided comfort, reminding him of the Lord's continual presence and sustaining power
He got a second wind so he could walk a few more miles
Only God knows where the path will take us, but we have our Lord's assurance, 'I am with you always'
This is not a metaphor or other figure of speech
He is real company
There is not one hour without His presence, not one mile without His companionship
Knowing He's with us makes the journey lighter.
When Secret Service agents train bank tellers to identify counterfeit bills, they show them both fake money and real money, and they study both
To detect a counterfeit problem, they must look for the differences in the genuine bill compared to the counterfeit, and not the similarities
In 1 John 2, the apostle John helps to protect believers from heresy by showing them examples of counterfeit Christians and teachers
One of the signs of the last days is the coming of antichrists
Antichrists are those who claim to have His power and authority but don't, or those who reject and oppose Him and His teachings
John gave three marks of false teachers who are controlled by the spirit of the antichrists: They depart from the fellowship , they deny Jesus as the Messiah , and they draw the faithful away from Jesus
He encouraged believers to protect themselves against the spirit of the antichrists by depending on the indwelling presence of the Spirit, knowing the truth, and remaining in fellowship with Jesus
We can protect ourselves from error and deception by knowing the false but relying on the Truth, Jesus Christ.
Have you ever tasted baby food
I have
It's terribly bland
But babies have no other choice without teeth
They certainly can't eat a nice, juicy steak
Sadly, some Christians are content with spiritual baby food
They are happy to go over and over the simple truths of the Scriptures and don't move beyond the basics of the gospel
By not sinking their teeth into deeper truths and more difficult Bible passages, they lack biblical understanding and convictions to make right choices
They may have been Christians for many years, but their spiritual abilities remain underdeveloped
They remain babies
As children grow physically, they learn to eat solid food that gives them strength and vitality
In the same way, every believer needs to take on the responsibility to feed himself on solid spiritual food
To fail to do this is to remain spiritually weak and undernourished
You can roughly tell the physical age of people by how they look
Their spiritual age is revealed by their ability to distinguish good from evil and by their personal character that's shown day by day
Is this spiritual discernment evident in your life
Or are you still on spiritual baby food?
Jerusalem was engulfed in flames, and the prophet Jeremiah wept
His prediction of divine judgment had largely gone unheeded
Now his terrible prophecy had come to pass with horrifying vividness
The short book of Lamentations records the prophet's grieving process over the destruction of Jerusalem
Jeremiah organized the book around the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, using a technique of alphabetic acrostics to aid the reader in memorizing the passages more easily
But using this technique also shows that he didn't cut short his grieving process
He took deliberate and intentional time to reflect upon and even to write down his heartbreak
In the midst of his grief, the comfort of God surfaced
Reminders of God's sovereignty and goodness gave the prophet hope as he faced the future 'The Lord will not cast off forever
Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion according to the multitude of His mercies'
If you've recently experienced a painful loss, remember to take adequate time to grieve and to reflect upon God's goodness
Then you will be able to experience His comfort and hope for the future.
While awaiting a routine medical procedure in a local hospital, I noticed a wall plaque showing Christ on a cross
Later, a nurse asked me several administrative questions, in-cluding, 'Do you have any spiritual needs you'd like to discuss with a chaplain?'
I said that I appreciated her asking that question, which I found unusual in today's world
She replied with a smile that they are a faith-based hospital and 'that's part of our mission.'
I was impressed that the people were not afraid to be who they are in an increasingly secular and pluralistic society
Peter urged the first-century believers who had been scattered by persecution and were living in a hostile world to consider it a blessing to suffer for the sake of what is right
'But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it
So don't worry or be afraid of their threats
Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life
And if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it'
Just as the woman at the hospital freely stated their faith, so we can express ours
And if we are criticized or treated unfairly because of our belief in Christ, we should respond with gentleness and respect
We should never be afraid to be who we are in Him.
Robyn and Steve have a counseling ministry that provides very little income
Recently, a family crisis forced them to embark on a 5,000-mile round trip in their well-used minivan
After attending to the crisis, they started back to Michigan
While about 2,000 miles from home, their van began to sputter and stall
A mechanic looked at it and told them, 'It's done
You need a new engine.'
Unable to afford one, they had no choice but to coax the van home
Three days, a case of oil, and a lot of prayers later, they miraculously limped into their driveway
Then they heard of a 'car missionary'
who assisted people in ministry
Amazed that the van had made it, he offered to replace the engine free of charge
If Steve had gotten the van fixed en route, it would have cost him thousands of dollars he didn't have
In Exodus 15, the Israelites were led by God into the desert
Three days into their trip, they ran out of water and had no way to get it
But God knew about the problem
In fact, a solution awaited them in Marah and Elim
God not only fixed their water problem but also provided a place to rest
Even when our situation looks difficult, we can trust that God is leading
He already knows what we'll need when we get there.
During the Cold War' a period of unrest between major world powers in the last half of the 20th century' Americans lived under the threat of nuclear war
I recall that during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, we seemed to be a heartbeat away from annihilation
It was heady stuff for a sixth-grader
One of my strangest memories of those turbulent times was the school safety drill
An alarm would sound, and we would hide under our desks, for protection from atomic bombs
Looking back, I'm certain it wouldn't have helped us in the event of a nuclear holocaust, it may have even given us a false sense of security
While we may not face the same level of nuclear threat today, there are still many dangers that scare us, and some of them are spiritual
Ephesians 6:12 reminds us that our battles are 'against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.'
These are mighty foes indeed, but God has given us His protective love and the spiritual resources of His armor
The result
While we face powerful enemies, 'we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us'
In our heavenly Father, we have true security.
When Sheri got engaged, her single friend Amy celebrated with her
She planned a bridal shower, helped pick out her wedding dress, walked down the aisle just before her, and stood by her side during the ceremony
When Sheri and her husband had children, Amy gave baby showers and rejoiced in her friend's blessings
Sheri told Amy later, 'You've comforted me during hard times, but the way I especially know you love me is that you rejoice with me in my good times
You haven't let any jealousy hold you back from celebrating with me.'
When John's disciples heard that a new rabbi named Jesus was gaining followers, they thought John might be jealous
They came to him and said, 'He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!'
But John celebrated Jesus' ministry, 'I have been sent before Him
The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice
Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled'
An attitude of humility should also characterize us
Rather than desiring attention for ourselves, everything we do should bring glory to our Savior
'He must increase, but I must decrease'
Autumn is hunting season here in Michigan
For a few weeks every year, licensed hunters are allowed to go out into the woods and hunt for various species of wildlife
Some hunters build elaborate tree stands high above the ground where they sit quietly for hours waiting for a deer to wander within rifle range
When I think of hunters who are so patient when it comes to waiting for deer, I think of how impatient we can be when we have to wait for God
We often equate 'wait' with 'waste'
If we're waiting for something , we think we are doing nothing, which, in an accomplishment-crazed culture, seems like a waste of time
But waiting serves many purposes
In particular, it proves our faith
Those whose faith is weak are often the first to give up waiting, while those with the strongest faith are willing to wait indefinitely
When we read the Christmas story in Luke 2, we learn of two people who proved their faith by their willingness to wait
Simeon and Anna waited long, but their time wasn't wasted; it put them in a place where they could witness the coming of Messiah
Not receiving an immediate answer to prayer is no reason to give up faith.
Where you live has a way of making certain demands on how you live
In my neighborhood, the garbage collector comes on Tuesday mornings. 
So it's my responsibility to get our garbage can out to the curb the night before
Letting the trash pile up on the curb for days before doesn't make for happy neighbors
And we have lots of children playing outside.
So signs are posted everywhere reminding drivers to slow down
That means I drive slowly and watch for little ones who, without looking, chase wayward balls into the street
It's important to remember that God has placed us into the 'kingdom of the Son'
Living in His neighborhood means there are life-transforming behavior patterns that should clearly reflect our spiritual location
This is why Paul reminds us that God's kingdom is not about arguing and bickering over earthly stuff but about 'righteousness and peace and joy'
Living by God's right standards, living to be a peacemaker, and living to be a source of joy in our relationships are what kingdom life is all about
And, when we live like this, our lives please God and bless others
Sounds like the kind of neighborhood anyone would love to live in!
It's my first day on the tractor
A crisp morning breeze brushes across the field
Crickets and country silence yield to the roar of the engine
Dropping the plow into the soil, I head out across the field
I look down at the gauges and gearshift, squeeze the cold steel of the steering wheel, and admire the power at my disposal
Finally, I look back to view the results
Instead of the ramrod straight line I was expecting, I see what looks like a slithering snake
with more bends and curves than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
We know better 'Plow with your eye on the fence post,'
By staying focused on a point across the field, a person plowing is assured of a straight line
On the return I comply, with telling results: The line is straight
The row was messed up only when I didn't have a focus point
Paul had similar wisdom when he wrote of having his focus on Jesus Christ and the impact it had on him
Not only did he ignore distractions , he set the focus , noted the result , and observed the pattern it sets for others
Like Paul, if we focus on Christ, we will plow a straight path and accomplish God's purpose in our lives.
While in Brazil, I went to see Iguazu Falls, one of the greatest waterfalls in the world
The massive falls are breathtaking
But what impressed me most at Iguazu was not the sight of the falls or the spray of the water, it was the sound
The sound was beyond deafening, I felt as if I was actually inside the sound itself
It was an overwhelming experience that reminded me how small I am by comparison
Later, with this scene in mind, I couldn't help but think about John in Revelation 1:15
While on the island of Patmos, he saw a vision of the risen Christ
The apostle described Jesus in the glory of His resurrection, noting both His clothing and His physical qualities
Then John described Christ's voice 'as the sound of many waters'
I'm not sure I fully appreciated what that meant until I visited Iguazu and was overwhelmed by the thundering sound of the falls
As those mighty waters reminded me of my own smallness, I better understood why John fell at the feet of Christ as if dead
Perhaps that description will help you grasp the awesomeness of Jesus' presence and prompt you to follow John's example of worshiping the Savior.
Ted, one of the elders in our church, used to be a police officer
One day after responding to a report of violence, he said the situation turned life-threatening
A man had stabbed someone and then menacingly turned the blade toward Ted
A fellow officer had taken position and fired his weapon at the assailant as he attacked Ted
The criminal was subdued, but Ted was shot in the crossfire
As he was driven by ambulance to the hospital, he felt deep waves of peace flowing over his soul from the Holy Spirit
Ted felt so tranquil that he was able to offer words of comfort to the law enforcement officer who was emotionally distraught over the crisis
The Lord Jesus promised us peace in crisis
Just hours before His own crucifixion, Christ comforted His disciples with these words: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid'
What is your worst fear
If you should have to face it, Christ will be there with you
Trusting Him through prayer makes available 'the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,'
and it 'will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus'
Author CS Lewis says that religious concepts are like soups, some are thick and some are clear
concepts in the Bible: mysteries, subtleties, and complexities that challenge the most accomplished mind
For example, '[God] has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens'
And yet, in the same volume there are thoughts that are crystal 'clear' simple, attainable, and easily grasped
What could ever surpass the simplicity of the clear affirmation in 1 John 4:16, 'God is love'?
John Cameron, a 15th-century writer, suggests, 'In the same meadow, the ox may lick up grass,
the bird may pick up seeds,
and a man finds a pearl; so in one and the same Scripture are varieties to be found for all sorts of conditions
In them, the lamb may wade, and the elephant swim, children may be fed with milk, and meat may be had for stronger men.'
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found in God's Book, the Bible, ocean depths that can stir the most sophisticated mind, and shallow areas that can be negotiated by any simple, honest soul
Why hesitate
'All Scripture is profitable'
The United States has spent millions of dollars looking for water on Mars
A few years ago, NASA sent twin robots, Opportunity and Spirit, to the red planet to see if water was present or had been present at one time
Why did the US do this
The scientists who are poring over data sent back from those two little Martian rovers are trying to figure out if life ever existed on Mars
And for that to have happened, there had to be water
No water, no life
Two thousand years ago, a couple of 'rovers'
set out across the countryside of an Earth-outpost called Samaria looking for water
One was a woman who lived nearby
The other was a man from Galilee
They ended up meeting at a well near the village of Sychar
When they did, Jesus found the water He was looking for, and the woman found the water she didn't know she needed
Water is essential for both physical and spiritual life
Jesus had a surprise for the woman at the well
He offered her the Water of Life, Himself
He is the refreshing, renewing 'fountain of water springing up into everlasting life'
Do you know anyone looking for water
Someone who is spiritually thirsty
Introduce that person to Jesus, the Living Water
It's the greatest discovery of all time.
I was walking in a subway in Minsk, Belarus, with my friend Yuliya and her daughter Anastasia when I suddenly fell face first onto the dirty concrete floor
I don't remember the fall, but I do remember suddenly having a mouth filled with sand, gravel, and grit
I couldn't get that stuff out of my mouth quickly enough
I didn't enjoy what went into my mouth on that embarrassing occasion
But Scripture teaches that it's more important to guard what comes out of our mouths
When the writer of Proverbs 15 said that 'the mouth of fools pours forth foolishness'
, the word translated pours forth literally means 'explodes out.'
Rash accusations, angry words, and verbal abuse can do immeasurable and lifelong harm
The apostle Paul spoke bluntly about this: 'Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth'
no dirty talk
He also said to '[put] away lying'
and to 'speak truth'
no lies
And later, 'Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you'
no character assassination
What comes out of our mouths should be wholesome and uplifting
We guard carefully what goes into our mouths, and rightly so
To honor God, let's also keep tight control on the words that come out of our mouths.
During a business trip to Philadelphia, I walked down Broad Street toward City Hall each morning to catch the subway
Each day I passed a long line of people waiting for something
They were a cross-section of humanity in age, ethnic origin, and appearance
After wondering about it for 3 days, I asked a man on the sidewalk why all those people were standing in line
He told me that they were on probation or parole after breaking the law and had to take a daily drug test to show that they were staying clean
This struck me as a vivid illustration of my need to stay spiritually clean before God
When the psalmist pondered how he could live a pure life, he concluded that the key was to consider and obey God's teaching
'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You
Blessed are You, O Lord; Teach me Your statutes
I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your Word'
In the light of God's Word, we see our sin, but we also see God's love in Christ
'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
By His grace staying clean.
A writer for The Washington Post conducted an experiment to test people's perception
He asked a famous violinist to perform incognito at a train station in the nation's capital one January morning
Thousands of people walked by as he played, but only a few stopped to listen
After 45 minutes, just $32 had been dropped into the virtuoso's open violin case
Two days earlier, this man, Joshua Bell, had used the same $3.5 million Stradivarius for a sold-out concert where people paid $100 a seat to hear him perform
The idea of a person not being recognized for his greatness isn't new
It happened to Jesus
'He was in the world,'
John said, '
and the world did not know Him'
Why did people who had been expecting the Messiah give Jesus such a cold reception
One reason is that they were surprised
Just as people today don't expect famous musicians to play in railway stations, the people in Jesus' day didn't expect Messiah to be born in a stable
They also expected Him to be a political king, not the head of a spiritual kingdom
The people in the first century were blinded to God's purpose in sending Jesus to this world
He came to save people from their sins
Receive God's surprising gift of salvation that He offers freely to you today.
Satan's sway over mankind began when he turned the minds of Adam and Eve against God
In order to pull it off, he had to lie to them about God, and they had to fall for it
In that defining moment, he lied to them about God's goodness, God's Word, and God's intentions
Satan is still up to his old tricks
Jesus said that when the devil 'speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar'
It should not be surprising, then, that when trouble interrupts our lives, the father of lies whispers in our ears and suddenly we are questioning God's goodness
When we are told to follow His commands, we wonder if His Word is really true in the first place
When Jesus tells us things like, 'Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth'
Satan tells us that the good life is about piling up things here, causing us to doubt God's good intentions
Our problem is that we, like Adam and Eve, believe Satan's lies
And when we do, our loyalty to God is compromised
Then our enemy slithers off to his next assignment, leaving us alone to face our regrets and the realization that his lies have seduced us away from our truest and dearest Friend
Who have you been listening to lately?
Although my culinary skills remain undeveloped, occasionally I use a box of premixed ingredients to make a cake
After adding eggs, vegetable oil, and water, I stir it all together
To bake a palate-pleasing cake, it's vital to have the correct balance of the right ingredients
That helps me picture the relationship of the greatest commandment and the Great Commission as we spread the gospel
When Jesus told His followers to go and make disciples of all nations, He did not give them permission to be rude and uncaring as they did so
His own citing of the 'first and great commandment'?, to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, was quickly followed by the call to 'love your neighbor as yourself'
Throughout the New Testament, we find this model of compassionate, respectful living restated many places, including 'the love chapter'
and Peter's instruction to give a reason for the hope within us 'with gentleness and respect'
In our eagerness to share Christ with others, we must always include a healthy balance of those two ingredients, the true gospel and godly love
This wonderfully sweet cake bakes best in the warmth of God's love.
Recently I read Psalm 131, one of my favorite psalms
In the past, I viewed it as an encouragement to understand that mystery is one of the hallmarks of God's character
It challenged me to let my mind be at rest, since I am unable to understand all that God is doing in His universe
But then I saw another side of David's calm spirit: I am unable to understand all that God is doing in me, and it is impossible to try
David draws a comparison between a weaned child that no longer frets for what it once demanded, and a soul that has learned the same lesson
It is a call to learn humility, patient endurance, and contentment in all my circumstances, whatever they are, though I do not understand God's reasons
Divine logic is beyond the grasp of my mind
I ask, 'Why this affliction
Why this anguish?'
The Father answers, 'Hush, child
You wouldn't understand if I explained it to you
Just trust Me!'
So, I turn from contemplating David's example to ask myself: Can I, in my circumstances, 'hope in the Lord'?
Can I wait in faith and patience without fretting and without questioning God's wisdom
Can I trust Him while He works in me His good, acceptable, and perfect will?
When Shayla McKnight applied for a job for an online printing company, she was surprised to learn that they had a zero-tolerance policy for gossip
The employees are encouraged to confront one another, instead of gossip about their fellow employees
If employees are caught gossiping, they are reprimanded, and if they continue, they are fired
Long before this kind of policy was ever implemented by a company, God spoke of His own zero-tolerance policy for gossip and slander among His people
Idle talk that foolishly or maliciously spreads rumors or facts about another person was forbidden
Solomon said that speaking badly of others could have disastrous effects
It betrays confidence , separates close friends , shames and saddles you with a bad reputation , and perpetually fuels the embers of a quarrel
People rarely can undo the damage their untrue words have done to a neighbor
Let's ask the Lord to help us not to engage in harmful talk about others
He wants us to set a guard over our mouths so that we'll instead speak all the good we know about everybody.
Have you ever been stuck in an airport
For 24 hours
In a city where you can't speak the language
Four thousand miles from home
It happened to a friend recently, and we can learn from his response
While most of us would find such an inconvenience intolerable, my friend John saw God's hand in his delay
As he waited out his forced stay, he looked for opportunities to connect with fellow passengers
He 'happened'
to find some fellow Christians from India, and in talking to them he heard about a ministry they were involved with
In fact, because John's interests matched his new friends' ministry, they invited him to India to participate in a short-term project
How often do we experience delays, changes of plans, and redirections and treat them as intrusions
It could be that God is detouring us so we can do something different or new for Him
Consider Paul's trip to Philippi in Acts 16
He had gone to Macedonia because of a God-directed vision
How could he know that he would end up in prison there
But even that trip to jail was God-led, because He used Paul to bring salvation to a jailer and his family
God can use inconveniences in our lives if we look at them as divine appointments.
For nearly a year, a former publishing colleague lived under a cloud of fear that he would be fired
A new boss in the department, for reasons unknown, began filling his personnel file with negative comments
Then, on the day my friend expected to lose his job, the new boss was fired instead
When the Israelites were taken as captives to Babylon, a Jew named Mordecai found himself in this kind of situation
Haman, the highest noble of King Xerxes, expected every royal official to kneel down and honor him, but Mordecai refused to bow to anyone but God
This outraged Haman and he set out to destroy not only Mordecai but every Jew in the whole Persian empire
Haman convinced Xerxes to sign a decree authorizing the destruction of all Jews and started building a gallows for the execution of Mordecai
But, in a startling turn of events, Haman was executed on the gallows he had built for Mordecai, and the Jewish people were spared
In literature, this is called poetic justice
Not everyone gets justice in such dramatic fashion, but Scripture promises that God will one day avenge all injustice
While we wait, we are to do what we can to work for justice and leave the results in God's hands.
Jeremiah has been called 'the weeping prophet.'
He may have had a sensitive and melancholic disposition that was compounded by his heartbreak over God's judgment on disobedient Israel
His capacity for sorrow is amazing: 'Oh, that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night!'
As if sorrow for his nation were not enough, Jeremiah was persecuted for his prophetic message of judgment
In one instance, Jeremiah was imprisoned in a cistern filled with mire
Opposition to his ministry had gotten the great prophet stuck in a place of despair
Sometimes in our attempts to serve the Lord, we can feel stuck in painful circumstances and surprising heartache
But the prophet's resilience should inspire us to persevere
Jeremiah's sense of divine call was so strong that he could not be deterred from serving the Lord
'But His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, and I could not'
Have the results of your service for the Lord been disappointing
Ask Him to renew your heart by His Spirit, and continue to serve God despite your setbacks.
During the quiet moments before a Sunday morning service, the organist played a hymn that was new to me
I turned to the page noted in the hymnal and read the words of the song 'The Lord My Shepherd Guards Me Well,'
a beautiful paraphrase of Psalm 23: The Lord my Shepherd guards me well, And all my wants are fed: Amid green pastures made to lie, Beside still waters led
My care-worn soul grows strong and whole When God's true path I tread
No matter how often we read or hear the familiar 23rd Psalm, it seems to come with a fresh message of God's care for us
Though I should walk in darkest ways Through valleys like the grave, No evil shall I ever fear; Your presence makes me brave
On my behalf Your rod and staff Assure me You will save
This image was familiar to the people who heard Jesus say, 'I am the good shepherd
The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep'
Unlike a hired person who runs away from danger, the true shepherd stays with the sheep to protect them
'But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees
I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep'
No matter what you're facing today, Jesus knows your name, He knows the danger, and He will not leave your side
You can say with confidence: The Lord my Shepherd guards me well!
My grandfather refused to say 'goodbye'?; he felt the word was too final
So, when we would drive away after family visits, his farewell ritual was always the same
Standing in front of the green ferns that lined his house, he would wave and call out, 'So long'?
As believers, we never have to say 'goodbye'
to the ones we love, as long as they have placed their trust in Jesus as Savior
The Bible promises that we will see them again
The apostle Paul said that we should not 'sorrow as others who have no hope'
because when Jesus returns, the Christians who have died will rise from their graves and, together with the believers who are still alive, will meet the Lord in the air
We have confidence that one day in heaven there will be 'no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying'
It's in that wonderful place that 'we shall always be with the Lord'
Christians have the hope of an eternal reunion with Christ and with believing loved ones who have passed away
That's why Paul exhorted us to 'comfort one another with these words'
Today, encourage someone with the hope that allows us to say 'so long,'
instead of 'goodbye.'?
Quaker John Woolman was an itinerant preacher who waged his own personal campaign to end slavery in colonial America
Woolman met with slave-holders to speak of the injustice of holding other human beings as property
Although Woolman did not eradicate slavery completely, he did persuade many masters to free their slaves
His success was due to individual, personal persuasion
The book of Philemon contains a similar one-on-one appeal
Onesimus was a runaway slave who had escaped from his Christian master Philemon
Onesimus had come to faith through Paul's ministry, and now Paul was sending him back to Philemon with these words: 'Perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever, no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother'
Although we don't know if Onesimus was set free from slavery, his new faith in Jesus had changed his relationship with his Christian master
He was now also a brother in Christ
Paul was influencing his world one heart at a time
By the transforming power of the gospel, people and situations can change
Like Woolman and like Paul, let's seek to influence our world one heart at a time.
Tough times can cause us to get our perspective turned around
I was reminded of this recently as I talked to a fellow-griever, another parent who, like Sue and me, lost a teenage daughter to death suddenly and without warning
She told me she had been missing her daughter terribly, and she told God she felt as if she were hanging on by her fingernails
Then she felt as if God reminded her that His hand of protection was there to hold her up, that she could let go, and He would catch her
That's a better perspective, isn't it
This picture reminds us that when troubles come and we feel least able to hold on to our faith, it's not up to us It's up to God to support us with His mighty hand
Psalm 37:23-24 says: 'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholds him with His hand.'
And Psalm 63:8 tells us: 'My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me.'
In tough times, we can become so preoccupied with our role in 'clinging to God'
that we forget about His promised protection
It's not our fingernails that sustain us, it's His loving, upholding hand.
Jason Bohn was a college student when he made a hole-in-one golf shot that won him a million dollars
While others may have squandered that money, Bohn had a plan
Wanting to be a pro golfer, he used the money as a living-and-training fund to improve his golf skills
The cash became an investment in his future, an investment that paid off when Bohn won the PGA Tour's 2005 B.C. Open
Bohn's decision to invest in the future instead of living for the moment was a wise one indeed
In a sense, that is what Jesus calls us to do
We have been entrusted with resources, time, ability, opportunity,  and we decide how to use them
Our challenge is to see those resources as an opportunity to invest long-term
'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,'
is how Jesus put it in Matthew 6:20
Those protected treasures cannot be destroyed nor taken away, Jesus assures us
Think of your resources: talent, time, knowledge
These are temporal and limited
But if you invest them with an eye toward eternity, these temporary things can have enduring impact
What is your focus
Now or forever
Invest in the future
It will not only have an eternal impact, but it will also change the way you view life each day.
I have a friend who was working in his home office one evening, trying to get some necessary paperwork done
His little girl, who was about 4 years old at the time, was playing around his desk, puttering about, moving objects here and there, pulling out drawers, and making a good deal of noise
My friend endured the distraction with stoic patience until the child slammed a drawer on one of her fingers and screamed in pain
Reacting in exasperation he shouted, 'That's it!'
as he escorted her out of the room and shut the door
Later, her mother found her weeping in her bedroom and tried to comfort her
'Does your finger still hurt?'
she asked
'No,'
the little girl sniffled
'Then why are you crying?'
her mother asked
''Cause,'
she whimpered, 'when I pinched my finger, Papa didn't say, '\sOh!''
Sometimes that's all we need, isn't it
Someone who cares and who will respond with kindness and compassion, someone who will say, 'Oh!'
We have One named Jesus who does that for us
Jesus loves us, understands our sorrows, and gave Himself for us
Now we are to 'walk in love'
and imitate Him.
A college football coach in the Bronx built his team around good character qualities
Instead of displaying their names on the back of their jerseys, the Maritime College players displayed words like family, respect, accountability, and character
Before each game, coach Clayton Kendrick-Holmes reminded his team to play by those principles on the field
The apostle Peter had his own list of Christian qualities that he encouraged believers to add to their life of faith: Virtue
Fulfilling God's design for a life with moral excellence
Knowledge
Studying God's Word to gain wisdom to combat falsehood
Self-control
Revering God so much that we choose godly behavior
Perseverance
Having a hopeful attitude even in difficulties because we're confident in God's character
Godliness
Honoring the Lord in every relationship in life
Brotherly kindness
Displaying a warmhearted affection for fellow believers
Love
Sacrificing for the good of others
Let's develop these qualities in increasing measure and integrate them into every part of our life.
Legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden had an interesting rule for his teams
Whenever a player scored, he was to acknowledge the person on the team who had assisted
When he was coaching high school, one of his players asked, 'Coach, won't that take up too much time?'
Wooden replied, 'I'm not asking you to run over there and give him a big hug
A nod will do.'
To achieve victory on the basketball court, Wooden saw the importance of teaching his players that they were a team, not 'just a bunch of independent operators.'
Each person contributed to the success of everyone else
That reminds me of the way the body of Christ should work
According to 1 Corinthians 12:19-20, each of us is a separate part of one body
'If they were all one member, where would the body be
there are many members, yet one body.'
Is the success of a pastor, a Bible study, or a church program based solely on one person's accomplishments
How many people contribute to the smooth operation of a church, a Christian organization, a family
Coach Wooden's rule and 1 Corinthians 12 are both rooted in the principle of seeing our need for one another
Let's use our gifts within the body of Christ to build up, strengthen, and help to carry out God's purposes .
Dave Randlett was someone of whom I can say, 'Because of him, my life will never be the same.'
Dave, who went to heaven in October 2010, became a mentor to me when I was a new follower of Jesus in my college years
He not only invested time in me, but he took risks by giving me opportunities to learn and grow in ministry
Dave was God's instrument to give me the opportunity to be a student preacher and travel with a college music team
As a result, he helped shape and prepare me for a life of teaching God's Word
I'm glad I was able to express thanks to him on a number of occasions
Just as I am thankful for Dave's influence in my life, the apostle Paul was grateful for Aquila and Priscilla, who served the Lord with him
He said they 'risked their own necks for my life.'
In gratitude, he thanked them, as did 'all the churches of the Gentiles'
You too may have people in your life who have taken risks by giving you opportunities to serve or who have greatly influenced you spiritually
Perhaps pastors, ministry leaders, friends, or family members have given of themselves to move you further along for Christ
The question is, have you thanked them?
A television program that I enjoy watching has a segment called Ambush Makeover
Two women are chosen to undergo 3 hours of pampering to update their hair, makeup, and wardrobe
The change is often dramatic
When the women step from behind a curtain, the audience gasps
Friends and family members sometimes start to cry
After all of this, the person with the new look finally gets to see herself
Some are so shocked that they keep looking in the mirror as if to find proof that it's really them
As the women walk across the set to join their companions, the former self becomes evident
Most do not know how to walk in their new shoes
Although they look chic, their clumsy walk gives them away
Their transformation is incomplete
This is true in our Christian lives as well
God does the work in us to give us a new start
but to walk in the way of the Lord requires time, effort, and lots of practice
If we just stand still and smile, we can pass as being transformed
But the way we walk tells how far along we are in living out that transformation
Being changed means giving up our previous way of life and learning a new way to walk .
One day when I was waiting to board a plane, a stranger who had overheard me mention that I was a chaplain began to describe to me his life before he met Christ
He said it was marked by 'sin and self-absorption
Then I met Jesus.'
I listened with interest to a list of changes he had made to his life and good deeds he had done
But because everything he told me was about his busyness for God and not his fellowship with God, I wasn't surprised when he added, 'Frankly, chaplain, I thought I'd feel better about myself by now.'
I think the New Testament character Martha would have understood that stranger's observation
Having invited Jesus to be a guest at her home, she set about doing what she thought were the important things
But this meant she couldn't focus on Jesus
Because Mary wasn't helping, Martha felt justified asking Jesus to chide her
It's a mistake many of us make: We're so busy doing good that we don't spend time getting to know God better
My advice to my new airplane friend came from the core of Jesus' words to Martha in Luke 10:41-42
I said to him: 'Slow down and invest yourself in knowing God; let His Word reveal Himself to you.'
If we're too busy to spend time with God, we're simply too busy.
When I was a teenager, my dad and I went on many hunting and fishing trips together
Most became happy memories, but one fishing expedition was nearly a disaster
We drove up into a high mountain range and set up camp in a remote area
Then Dad and I trudged a long way down the mountain to get to a stream to fish
After a long day fishing in the hot sun, it was time to return to camp
But as we began to head back, Dad's face grew pale
He was dizzy and nauseated, and he had almost no strength
Trying not to panic, I had him sit down and drink liquids
Then I prayed aloud to God for help
Bolstered by prayer, rest, and nourishment, Dad improved, and we began to go slowly back up the mountain
He held on to my loosened belt as I crawled upward, leading the way back to camp
Sometimes we find ourselves in what feels like a hopeless valley without the strength to go on
When this happens, it's important to recall God's promise: 'He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength'
Do you feel drained
Exhausted
Ask God for help
Depend on Him for the power to go on and the strength to make it through the valley.
When we quote The Apostles' Creed, we say, 'I believe in the Holy Spirit.'
Author JB Phillips said, 'Every time we say [this] we mean that we believe that [the Spirit] is a living God able and willing to enter human personality and change it.'
Sometimes we forget that the Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force
The Bible describes Him as God
He possesses the attributes of God: He is present everywhere , He knows all things , and He has infinite power
He also does things that only God can do: create and give life
He is equal in every way with the other Persons of the Trinity, the Father and the Son
The Holy Spirit is a Person who engages in personal ways with us
He grieves when we sin
He teaches us , prays for us , guides us , gives us spiritual gifts , and assures us of salvation
The Holy Spirit indwells us if we have received forgiveness of sin through Jesus
He desires to transform us so that we become more and more like Jesus
Let's cooperate with the Spirit by reading God's Word and relying on His power to obey what we learn.
A long-time friend described the days surrounding his 90th birthday as 'a time
to do a little reflecting, looking in the rearview mirror of my life, and spending many hours in what I call '\sThe Grace of Remembrance' 
It's so easy to forget all the ways that the Lord has led
'\sForget not all His benefits'
This was typical of the person I've known and admired for more than 50 years
Rather than reviewing disappointments, his letter was filled with thankfulness and praise to God
First, he recalled the Lord's temporal mercies, his good health, the enjoyment of his wife and children, the joy and success of work, his enriching friendships, and the opportunities he'd had to serve God
He considered them all gifts, none deserved, but all gratefully received
Next, he reviewed God's spiritual mercies, the influence of Christian parents and the experience of God's forgiveness when he accepted Christ as a teenager
He concluded with the encouragement he'd received from churches, schools, and Christian men who cared and prayed for each other
It's a model we should follow on a regular basis, the joy of remembering
'Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!'
During a documentary on World War I, the narrator said that if Britain's casualties in 'the war to end all wars'
were marched four abreast past London's war monument, the processional would take 7 days to complete
This staggering word picture set my mind spinning at the awful cost of war
While those costs include monetary expense, destruction of property, and economic interruption, none of these compare to the human cost
Both soldiers and civilians pay the ultimate price, multiplied exponentially by the grief of the survivors
War is costly
When believers go to war with one another, the cost is also high
James wrote, 'Where do wars and fights come from among you
Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?'
In our own selfish pursuits, we sometimes battle without considering the price exacted on our witness to the world or our relationships with one another
Perhaps that is why James preceded these words with the challenge, 'Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace'
If we are to represent the Prince of Peace in our world, believers need to stop fighting with one another and practice peace.
When it was learned that the biggest football game of the 2011 season was scheduled to be played on Yom Kippur, the student government at the University of Texas petitioned school officials to change the date
They said it was unfair to make Jewish students choose between the classic football rivalry with Oklahoma and observing their most important and sacred holy day of the year
But the date was not changed
Even in societies where people have religious freedom, difficult choices are still required of every person of faith
Daniel demonstrated the courage to obey God no matter what the consequences
When his political rivals set a trap to eliminate him from their path to power , he didn't challenge the law or complain that he had been wronged
'When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home
And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days'
Daniel didn't know if God would save him from the lions' den, but it didn't matter
He chose to honor God in his life whatever the outcome
Like Daniel, we are free to choose to follow the Lord.
Usually we're told to smile before someone takes our picture
But in some parts of the US, a no-smiling policy is enforced when getting your photo taken for a driver's license
Because of identity theft, these motor vehicle departments carefully check new photos that are taken to be sure they don't match photos already in the system
If someone gets a picture taken under a false name, an alarm is sent to the operator
From 1999 to 2009, one state stopped 6,000 people from getting fraudulent licenses
But why no smiling
The technology recognizes a face more easily if the person has a neutral facial expression
Jesus prescribed a good way to recognize a Christian
He told His disciples, 'By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another'
The ways to show love to fellow believers are as endless as there are people with needs: a note of encouragement, a visit, a meal, a gentle rebuke, a prayer, a Bible verse, a listening ear, even just a friendly smile
The apostle John wrote, 'We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren'
Can others recognize, by our care for fellow Christians, that we know and love the Lord?
I was frustrated that despite my repeated calls, the streetlight in front of my house was still out
Because we don't have sidewalks and there is such a large distance between the streetlights, it's important that each light is functional to illuminate the darkness
I worried that I might hit one of the school kids as I pulled out of my driveway in the early morning hours
The idea of light is used frequently in the Bible
Jesus said that He is the Light of the world
We are told to 'put on the armor of light'
by clothing ourselves with the Lord
And Matthew 5:16 instructs that we should 'let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works and glorify [our] Father in heaven.'
A light that doesn't shine has lost its usefulness
Jesus said that no one hides a light under a basket but puts it on a lampstand to illuminate everything around it
Our light should point people to the One who is the Light
We don't have any light in ourselves, but we shine with the reflection of Christ
God has placed each of us in a specific environment that will best allow us to shine with His light
Don't be like a burned-out streetlight
Shine on!
Buying and selling real estate in the US is tricky business these days
Housing prices have dropped significantly, and if you're trying to unload commercial property it's even more difficult
So, in the game of real estate, it remains important to keep this old adage in mind: 'The three most important things to know about buying and selling property are location, location, location!'
The same is true of living for Jesus
Knowing our location spiritually is critical if we are to succeed in navigating through the greatly devalued territory of our world
Paul reminds us that we have a new location in Christ, having been delivered 'from the power of darkness and conveyed into the kingdom of the Son'
Knowing that we have been relocated by His amazing grace into the kingdom of Jesus makes a difference
Jesus now reigns as King in our hearts and minds, and we are His grateful subjects
His will is our will and His ways become patterns for all of life and behavior
And when we are forced to make a choice, our allegiance is to Him
So, when the temptations and the seductions of the darkness from which you have been removed threaten His reign in your heart, remember your new postal code: Colossians 1:13!
When the deck behind our house began caving in, I knew its repair would exceed my abilities
So I made some calls, got some bids, and picked a builder to construct a new deck
Once the contractor was done, I took a close look at his work and noticed some problems
Seeking a second opinion, I called the local building inspector and got a surprise
The deck guy had not obtained a building permit
Working without official oversight, he had violated many points of the building code
This incident reminded me of an important truth : We often do less than our best if we don't have any accountability to the authority over us
In Scripture, we see this principle explained in two of Jesus' parables
In both cases, at least one unsupervised worker failed when the master was gone
But then we see a different approach in Proverbs 6
We see the example of the ant, which does good work without a visible supervisor
It intrinsically does its work without being monitored
What about us
Do we do good work only when someone is watching
Or do we recognize that all our service is for God, and so do our best at all times, even when no human authority is watching?
Thomas Moore was an Irish songwriter, singer, and poet
His talents brought joy to many who saw him perform or who sang his music
Yet, tragically, his personal life was troubled by repeated heartaches, including the death of all five of his children during his lifetime
Moore's personal wounds make these words of his all the more meaningful: 'Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish; earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.'
This moving statement reminds us that meeting with God in prayer can bring healing to the troubled soul
The apostle Paul also saw how our heavenly Father can provide solace to the hurting heart
To the believers at Corinth he wrote: 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation'
Sometimes, though, we can be so preoccupied with an inner sorrow that we isolate ourselves from the One who can offer consolation
We need to be reminded that God's comfort and healing come through prayer
As we confide in our Father, we can experience peace and the beginning of healing for our wounded hearts
For truly 'earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.'?
My next record should be 45 minutes of silence,'
said singer Meg Hutchinson, 'because that's what we're missing most in society.'
Silence is indeed hard to find
Cities are notoriously noisy due to the high concentration of traffic and people
There seems to be no escape from loud music, loud machines, and loud voices
But the kind of noise that endangers our spiritual well-being is not the noise we can't escape but the noise we invite into our lives
Some of us use noise as a way of shutting out loneliness: voices of TV and radio personalities give us the illusion of companionship
Some of us use it as a way of shutting out our own thoughts: other voices and opinions keep us from having to think for ourselves
Some of us use noise as a way of shutting out the voice of God: constant chatter, even when we're talking about God, keeps us from hearing what God has to say
But Jesus, even during His busiest times, made a point of seeking out places of solitude where He could carry on a conversation with God
Even if we can't find a place that is perfectly quiet, we need to find a place to quiet our souls , a place where God has our full attention.
Driving home from work, I heard a radio advertisement that got my attention
It was for a computer program that checks e-mails as they are written
I was familiar with spell check and grammar check programs, but this was different
This was 'tone check.'
The software monitors the tone and wording of e-mails to make certain they are not overly aggressive, unkind, or mean-spirited
As I listened to the announcer describe the features of this software, I wondered what it would be like to have something like that for my mouth
How many times have I reacted harshly instead of listening first, and later regretted the words I had spoken
Certainly a tone check would have protected me from responding so foolishly
Paul saw the need for us as believers to check our speech, especially when talking to those who are not Christians
He said, 'Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
His concern was that our speech be graceful, reflecting the beauty of our Savior and it must be inviting to others
Talking with the right tone to unbelievers is vital to our ability to witness to them
Colossians 4:6 can be our tone check.
In his book Long for This World, Jonathan Weiner writes about science's promise to radically extend how long we live
At the center of the book is English scientist Aubrey de Grey, who predicts that science will one day offer us 1,000-year lifespans
Aubrey claims that molecular biology has finally placed a cure for aging within our reach
But what difference does it make if, after living 1,000 years, we will eventually die anyway
De Grey's prediction only postpones facing the ultimate question of what happens when we die
It does not answer it
The Scriptures tell us that death is not the end of our existence
Instead, we are assured that everyone will stand before Christ, believers for their works and nonbelievers for their rejection of Him
All of us are sinners and in need of forgiveness
And only Christ's death on the cross has provided forgiveness for all who believe
The Bible says, 'It is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment'
Our appointed face-to-face encounter with God puts everything in perspective
So whether we live 70 years or 1,000, the issue of eternity is the same: 'Prepare to meet your God!'
While visiting the ruins of Hadrian's Wall in Northern England, I reflected on the fact that this may be the most remembered achievement of the Roman emperor who came to power in ad 117
As many as 18,000 Roman soldiers manned this 80-mile-long barrier, built to keep the northern barbarians from invading the south
Hadrian is remembered for building a physical wall to keep people out
In contrast, Jesus Christ is remembered for tearing down a spiritual wall to let people in
When the early church experienced tension between believers of Jewish and non-Jewish birth, Paul told them that, through Christ, they stood equally in the family of God
'For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation
so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace
For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father'
One of the most beautiful aspects of the Christian faith is the unity among those who follow Jesus
Through His death on the cross, Christ has removed the barriers that so often separate people and has drawn us together in true friendship and love.
It can be quite discouraging for wanna-be writers to get their work rejected time after time
When they send in a manuscript to a publisher, they'll often hear back in a letter with these words: 'Thank you
But your submission does not meet our needs at this time.'
Sometimes this really means 'not at this time, or ever.'
So they try the next publisher and the next
I've found that the phrase This does not meet our needs at this time, or ever can be a helpful saying in my Christian walk to renew my mind and refocus my thoughts on the Lord
Here's what I mean
When starting to worry, we can remind ourselves: 'Worry does not meet my needs at this time, or ever
My heart's need is to trust God
I will '\sbe anxious for nothing' '
When we envy what another person has or does, we can reinforce the truth: 'Envy does not meet my needs at this time, or ever
My need is to give thanks to God
His Word says, '\sEnvy is rottenness to the bones' , and '\sIn everything give thanks' '
We can't renew our minds by ourselves ; it's the transforming work of the Holy Spirit who lives in us
Yet speaking the truth in our thoughts can help us to submit to the Spirit's work within.
Conventional wisdom questions how much can be accomplished with little
We tend to believe that a lot more can be done if we have large financial resources, talented manpower, and innovative ideas
But these things don't matter to God
Consider just a couple of examples: In Judges 3:31, a relatively unknown man named Shamgar delivered Israel from the Philistines single-handedly
How He won a great victory by killing 600 Philistines with nothing more than an oxgoad
In Exodus, when God asked Moses to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt, Moses was afraid the people wouldn't listen to him or follow him
So God said, 'What is that in your hand?'
Moses replied, 'A rod.'
God went on to use that rod in Moses' hand to convince the people to follow him, to turn the Nile River into blood, to bring great plagues on Egypt, to part the Red Sea, and to perform miracles in the wilderness
Moses' rod and Shamgar's oxgoad, when dedicated to God, became mighty tools
This helps us see that God can use what little we have, when surrendered to Him, to do great things
God is not looking for people with great abilities, but for those who are dedicated to following and obeying Him.
Before she was 2 years old, my granddaughter Katie did something that would make any grandpa proud: She began to recognize cars by make and year
This all started when she and her daddy began spending time together playing with his old collection of toy cars
Daddy would say, 'Katie, get the 1957 Chevy,'
and she would pick it out of the hundreds of tiny cars
And once, while he was reading a Curious George book to her, she climbed down from his lap and ran to get a miniature Rolls Royce, an exact replica of the car pictured in the book
If a 2-year-old child can make such connections, doesn't that show the importance of teaching children the right things early on
We can do this by using what I call the FIRM principle: Familiarity, Interest, Recognition, and Modeling
This follows Moses' pattern in Deuteronomy 6 of taking every opportunity to teach biblical truths so that children become familiar with them and make them a part of their lives
Using their interests as teaching opportunities, we repeat Bible stories so they become recognizable, while modeling a godly life before them
Let's give the children in our lives a FIRM foundation by teaching them about God's love, Christ's salvation, and the importance of godly living.
Someone once asked me why she should be like Jesus now since she would become like Him when she got to heaven
Great question
Especially when it's easier to just be yourself
Actually, there are several reasons why becoming like Him now is important, but one is near the top
When we see and stand before Him, we will give an account as to whether or not we lived in ways that were consistent with His will
Or, as Paul put it, whether or not we have built on Him as our foundation with 'gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, [or] straw'
All that we do to advance His kingdom, things like contribute to the strength of His church, serve the poor and needy, and promote righteousness and justice as He did, is like building with essential materials that will survive the fire of His judgment
On the contrary, building with things that reflect our fallen ways, and living to advance ourselves and our earthly desires are commodities that will turn into a pile of ashes before the consuming fire of His glory
I don't know about you, but I'd rather love Jesus enough to live like Him now, for the thought of standing before Him in a heap of ashes is an unthinkable alternative.
It happened again
I got the urge to clean my office
Before I could resist, I had created an even bigger mess than I started with
One pile turned into many piles when I started sorting books, papers, and magazines
As the mess mushroomed, I lamented that I had started
But there was no going back
When God recruited Moses to rescue the Hebrews from slavery, their situation went from bad to worse as well
There was no doubt that the job needed to be done
The people had been crying out to God to help them
Reluctantly, very reluctantly, Moses agreed to appeal to Pharaoh on behalf of the Hebrews
The encounter did not go well
Instead of releasing the people, Pharaoh increased his unreasonable demands
Moses questioned whether he should have started
Only after a lot more trouble for a lot of people did Pharaoh let the people leave
Whenever we set out to do something good, even when we're certain that God wants us to do it, we shouldn't be surprised when the situation gets worse before it gets better
This doesn't prove that we're doing the wrong thing; it just reminds us that we need God to accomplish everything.
Recently I was called for jury duty
It meant extraordinary inconvenience and lots of lost time, but it was also serious business
During the first day's orientation, the judge lectured us on the responsibility at hand and the important nature of the task
We were going to sit in judgment of people who either had disputes or were charged with crimes
I felt a great sense of inadequacy for the task at hand
Passing judgment on another person, with serious life consequences riding on the decision, is not a simple thing
Because we're flawed human beings, we may not always make the right judgments
While the justice systems of our world might struggle and falter because of the inherent failings of the humans that manage them, we can always trust our God to excel in wisdom and fairness
The psalmist sang, 'The Lord reigns; the world also is firmly established, it shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously'
God judges according to righteousness, defined by His own perfect justice and flawless character
We can trust God now when life seems unfair, knowing that He will one day make all things right in His final court 
Dr Jack Mezirow, professor emeritus at Columbia Teachers College, believes that an essential element in adult learning is to challenge our own ingrained perceptions and examine our insights critically
Dr Mezirow says that adults learn best when faced with what he calls a 'disorienting dilemma'?, something that 'helps you critically reflect on the assumptions you've acquired'
This is the opposite of saying, 'My mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts.'
When Jesus healed on the Sabbath, He challenged the deeply held beliefs of many religious leaders, and they sought to silence Him
Jesus said to them: 'You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
Oswald Chambers observed, 'God has a way of bringing in facts which upset a man's doctrines if these stand in the way of God getting at his soul.'
Unsettling experiences that cause us to question our assumptions about the Lord can also lead us to a deeper understanding and trust in Him, if we're willing to think it through and come to Him.
Has your heart ever been broken
What broke it
Cruelty
Failure
Unfaithfulness
Loss
Perhaps you've crept into the darkness to cry
It's good to cry
'Tears are the only cure for weeping,'
said Scottish preacher George MacDonald
A little crying does one good
Jesus wept at His friend Lazarus' grave , and He weeps with us
His heart was broken as well
Our tears attract our Lord's lovingkindness and tender care
He knows our troubled, sleepless nights
His heart aches for us when we mourn
He is the 'God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation'
And He uses His people to comfort one another
But tears and our need for comfort come back all too frequently in this life
Present comfort is not the final answer
There is a future day when there will be no death, no sorrow, no crying, for all these things will 'have passed away'
There in heaven God will wipe away every tear
We are so dear to our Father that He will be the one who wipes the tears away from our eyes; He loves us so deeply and personally
Remember, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted'
Many will remember the fall season of 2008 as the beginning of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of 1929
In the months to follow, many lost their jobs, homes, and investments
In a BBC interview a year later, Alan Greenspan, former head of the US Federal Reserve, indicated that the average person doesn't believe it will happen again
He said, 'That is the unquenchable capability of human beings when confronted with long periods of prosperity to presume that it will continue.'
Assuming that things will continue as they always have is not just 21st-century-type thinking
In the first century, Peter wrote of people who thought that life would continue as it was and that Jesus would not return
He said, 'Since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation'
Jesus said He would come back, but the people continued to live in disobedience as though He would never return
But His delay is only because of God's patience with us, for He is 'not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'
Paul tells us that Christians ought to live 'soberly, right­eously, and godly'
in the light of Christ's certain return
Are you ready to meet Him?
Most of us would agree that life has its ups and downs
Wise King Solomon believed this and reflected on our responses to fluctuating circumstances
In Ecclesiastes, he wrote: 'To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven:
a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance'
Solomon's father, David, was called 'a man after [God's] own heart'
Yet David's life illustrates how life is filled with seasons of ups and downs
David wept over his and Bathsheba's first child who was fatally ill
Yet he also wrote songs of praise and joyous laughter
With the death of his rebellious son Absalom, David experienced a time of deep mourning
And when the ark was brought to Jerusalem, David, in spiritual ecstasy, danced before the Lord
We do a disservice to ourselves and others when we portray the Christian life as peaceful and happy all the time
Instead, the Bible portrays the believer's life as consisting of seasons of ups and downs
In what season are you
Whether a time of joy or sadness, each season should motivate us to seek the Lord and trust Him.
Twenty-month-old James was leading his family confidently through the hallways of their large church
His daddy kept an eye on him the whole time as James toddled his way through the crowd of 'giants.'
Suddenly the little boy panicked because he could not see his dad
He stopped, looked around, and started to cry, 'Daddy, Daddy!'
His dad quickly caught up with him and little James reached up his hand, which Daddy strongly clasped
Immediately James was at peace
Second Kings tells the story of King Hezekiah who reached up to God for help
Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, had made threats against Hezekiah and the people of Judah, saying, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you
You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered?'
King Hezekiah went to the Lord and prayed for deliverance so 'that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God'
In answer to his prayer, the angel of the Lord struck down the enemy, and Sennacherib withdrew
If you're in a situation where you need God's help, reach up your hand to Him in prayer
He has promised His comfort and help .
The first time I saw her, I fell in love
She was a beauty
Sleek
Clean
Radiant
As soon as I spied the 1962 Ford Thunderbird at the used-car lot, her shiny exterior and killer interior beckoned me
I knew this was the car for me
So I plunked down $800 and purchased my very first car
But there was a problem lurking inside my prized possession
A few months after I bought my T-Bird, it suddenly became particular about which way I could go
It allowed me to go forward, but I couldn't go backward
It had no reverse
Although not having reverse is a problem in a car, sometimes it's good for us to be a little like my old T-Bird
We need to keep going forward, without the possibility of putting life into reverse
In our walk with Jesus, we need to refuse to go backward
Paul said it simply: We need to 'press toward the goal'
Perhaps the children of Israel could have used my T-Bird's transmission
We read in Exodus 16 that they were in danger of putting life into reverse
Despite the many miracles God had performed, they longed for Egypt and failed to trust that He could guide them forward
We need to keep moving ahead in our walk with God
Don't back up
Look forward
Press on.
The Israelites and the Philistines were at war
While Saul relaxed under a pomegranate tree with his men, Jonathan and his armor-bearer left camp quietly to see if the Lord would work on their behalf, believing that 'nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few'
Jonathan and his helper were about to cross a path between two high cliffs
Armed enemy soldiers were stationed above them on both sides
They were two men against who knows how many
When Jonathan suggested they climb up after them, the armor-bearer never flinched
'Do all that is in your heart,'
he told Jonathan
'I am with you, according to your heart'
So the two climbed the cliff, and with God's help they overcame the enemy
We have to admire this courageous young armor-bearer
He lugged the armor up that cliff and stayed with Jonathan, following along behind and killing those Jonathan wounded
The church needs strong leaders to face our spiritual foes, but they must not be left to face them alone
They need the help and support of everyone in the congregation, loyal 'armor-bearers'
like you and me who are willing to join them in battle against the 'enemy of our souls.'?
One day I found my son straining to lift a pair of four-pound barbells over his head, an ambitious feat for a toddler
He had raised them only a few inches off the ground, but his eyes were determined and his face was pink with effort
I offered to help, and together we heaved the weight up toward the ceiling
The heavy lifting that was so hard for him was easy for me
Jesus has this perspective on the stuff that's hard for us to manage
When life seems like a carousel of catastrophes, Jesus isn't fazed by a fender-bender, troubled by a toothache, or harassed by a heated argument, even if it all happens in one day
He can handle anything, and that is why He said, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden'
Are you worn out from ongoing problems
Are you weighed down with stress and worry
Jesus is the only real solution
Approaching the Lord in prayer allows us to cast our burdens on Him so that He can sustain us
Today, ask Him to assist you with everything
By helping you with your burdens, He can supply rest for your soul, for His yoke is easy and His burden is light .
&#8220;Lacks ambition.'
That is not a phrase you want to see on your performance review
When it comes to work, employees who lack ambition seldom rise to the top of an organization
Without a strong desire to achieve something, nothing is accomplished
Ambition, however, has a dark side
It often has more to do with elevating self than with accomplishing something noble for others
This was the case with many of the kings of Israel, including the first one
Saul started out with humility, but he gradually came to consider his position as something that belonged to him
He forgot that he had a special assignment from God to lead His chosen people in a way that would show other nations the way to God
When God relieved him of duty, Saul's only concern was for himself
In a world where ambition often compels people to do whatever it takes to rise to positions of power over others, God calls His people to a new way of living
We are to do nothing out of selfish ambition and to lay aside the weight of sin that ensnares us
If you want to be someone who truly 'rises up,'
make it your ambition to humbly love and serve God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength .
It seems that young people in China are beginning to forget how to write the characters that comprise the beautiful calligraphy of their traditional language
Some are calling the phenomenon 'character amnesia.'
Heavy usage of computers and smart phones often means that writing is neglected and some can no longer remember the characters they learned in childhood
One young man said, 'People don't write anything by hand anymore except for [their] name and address.'
Some people appear to have 'character amnesia'
of a different sort
When faced with a dilemma, they seem to 'forget'
the right thing to do and instead choose the easy way out
God called Job 'a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil'
God allowed Satan to take everything Job had, his children, his wealth, and his health
But despite his heart-wrenching circumstances, Job refused to curse God
'In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong'
Satan had challenged God's assertion of Job's blameless character, but he was proven wrong
Character amnesia
No
Character is who we are; it's not something we 'forget'
As I was talking with a gentleman whose wife had died, he shared with me that a friend said to him, 'I'm sorry you lost your wife.'
His reply
'Oh, I haven't lost her; I know exactly where she is!'
To some this may seem like a rather bold or even flippant assertion
With so many after-death theories, one might wonder how we can be really sure where our loved ones go after death, let alone where we ourselves will end up
Yet, confidence is appropriate for followers of Jesus Christ
We have the assurance from God's Word that when we die we will immediately be with our Lord
Thankfully, this is more than just wishful thinking
It is grounded in the historic reality of Jesus, who came and died to cancel our penalty for sin so that we could receive eternal life
He then proved that there was life after death by exiting His grave and ascending into heaven where, as He promised, He is preparing a place for us
So, rejoice
Since the benefits of this reality are out of this world, we can boldly say with Paul that 'we are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord'
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001
It's hard to think about that date without mental images of the destruction, grief, and loss that swept over America and the world following those tragic events
The loss of thousands of lives was compounded by the depth of loss felt corporately, a lost sense of security as a country
The sorrow of loss, personal and corporate, will always accompany the memory of the events of that day
Those horrific events are not the only painful memories of September 11
It also marks the anniversary of my father-in-law's death
Jim's loss is felt deeply within our family and his circle of friends
No matter what kind of sorrow we experience, there is only one real comfort, the mercy of God
David, in his own heartache, cried to his heavenly Father, 'Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my eye wastes away with grief, yes, my soul and my body!'
Only in the mercy of God can we find comfort for our pain and peace for our troubled hearts
In all losses, we can turn to the true Shepherd, Jesus Christ, who alone can heal our brokenness and grief.
When US airspace was closed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, planes had to land at the closest airport available
Nearly 40 planes landed in Gander, Newfoundland
Suddenly this small Canadian community almost doubled in size when thousands of frightened passengers arrived
People opened their homes, and officials converted high schools, lodges, churches, and meeting halls into places to stay
Stranded passengers were overwhelmed with neighborly generosity and kindness
The people of Gander showed the kind of love described in Hebrews 13: 'Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels'
This is probably referring to Abraham when he entertained three men who came to tell him that he would soon have a son
Two of the 'men'
were angels, and one was the Angel of the Lord
Bruce says about Abraham, 'Among the Jews, Abraham was regarded as outstanding for his hospitality as [he was] for his other virtues; a true son of Abraham must be hospitable too.'
God calls believers to show their love and gratefulness for Him in their good works of hospitality and compassion
How will you answer His call today?
During my seminary years, I directed a summer day camp for boys and girls at the YMCA
Each morning, I began the day with a brief story in which I tried to incorporate an element of the gospel
To help illustrate that becoming a Christian means to become a new creation in Christ, I told a story about a moose that wanted to be a horse
The moose had seen a herd of wild horses, thought them elegant creatures, and wanted to be like them
So he taught himself to act like a horse
However, he was never accepted as a horse because he was a moose
How can a moose become a horse
Only by being born a horse, of course
And then I would explain how we can all be born again by believing in Jesus
One summer I had a staff counselor named Henry who was very hostile to the faith
I could do nothing but love him and pray for him, but he left at the end of the summer hardened in unbelief
That was more than 50 years ago
A few years ago I received a letter from Henry
The first sentence said: 'I write to tell that I have been born again and now, at last, I am a 'horse'
This confirmed to me that we need to keep praying and planting the seed of the Word so that it may bear fruit one day.
In 1876, Henry Clay Work wrote the song 'My Grandfather's Clock.'
The song describes a grandfather's clock that faithfully ticks its way through its owner's life
Childhood, adulthood, and old age are all viewed in relationship to his beloved timepiece
The refrain says: Ninety years without slumbering,  Tick, tock, tick, tock,  His life's seconds numbering,  Tick, tock, tick, tock,  But it stopped, short,  Never to go again,  When the old man died
The relentless ticking of the clock reminds us that our time on earth is limited
Despite the joys and pains of life, time always marches on
For the believer, our time on earth is an opportunity for gaining wisdom
The psalmist writes, 'Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom'
One way of numbering our days is to ask ourselves these kinds of questions: How can I become more like Christ
Am I reading the Word regularly
Am I devoting time to prayer
Am I meeting together with other believers
The way we answer these questions is an indicator of the progress we're making in gaining wisdom and becoming more like Christ
No matter the phase of life, childhood, youth, middle age, or our senior years, life always affords us opportunities to grow in faith and wisdom
Numbering our days is the wise response to life's inevitable progress
How are you progressing on your journey?
During the past 135 years of Major League Baseball, only 20 pitchers have thrown a perfect game
On June 2, 2010, Armando Galarraga of the Detroit Tigers would have been number 21 but an umpire's mistake denied him what every pitcher dreams of
The video replay showed the truth
Even though the umpire later acknowledged his error and apologized to Galarraga, the call made on the field could not be changed
Through it all, Galarraga remained calm, expressed sympathy for the umpire, and never criticized him
Armando's refusal to retaliate amazed fans, players, and sportswriters alike
If we insist on fair treatment for ourselves, we can become angry and frustrated
But when we embrace the Bible's wisdom, we will seek the welfare of others
Proverbs calls us 'to perceive the words of understanding, to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, judgment, and equity'
Oswald Chambers said of our personal dealings with others, 'Never look for justice, but never cease to give it; and never allow anything you meet with to sour your relationship to men through Jesus Christ.'
When we experience unfairness, it is our privilege and responsibility as followers of Christ to respond with honesty and integrity, doing what is right, just, and fair.
When a high school student tried using a thermometer to measure a table, his teacher was dumbfounded
In 15 years of teaching, Dave had seen many sad and shocking situations
But even he was amazed that a student could make it to high school without knowing the difference between a ruler and a thermometer
When a friend told me this story, my heart broke for that student and others like him who have fallen so far behind in their education
They can't move forward because they haven't yet learned basic lessons of everyday life
But then a sobering thought came to me: Don't we sometimes do the same thing when we use wrong spiritual measuring devices
For example, do we assume that churches with the most resources are the most blessed by God
do we ever think that popular preachers are more godly than those with few followers
The proper measure of our spiritual condition is the quality of our lives, which is measured by such attributes as lowliness, gentleness, and longsuffering
'Bearing with one another in love'
is a good indication that we are moving toward God's goal for us: 'the measure of the fullness of Christ'
Some Christians grow up believing work is bad, that it's a curse brought about by Adam and Eve's sin
Left uncorrected, this mistaken belief can cause people to feel that what they do in their jobs every day isn't important to God, or at the very least, isn't as important as the work of missionaries and pastors
This is not true, as Genesis 1:26-31 teaches us
First, we learn that God Himself works, as evidenced by the labor involved in creation and by the fact that He rested on the seventh day
Then we discover that we were made in His image and that we were granted dominion over creation
This implies that we are to work to tend creation
Clearly, the tending of God's creation is work, noble work, for God looked upon His labors and declared them 'very good'
It mustn't escape our notice either that work was declared good before sin entered the picture
In other words, work didn't result from the fall and therefore is not a curse
We see this idea again in Genesis 2, when God 'took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it'
Let's approach each day's labor, whether at a job or doing another activity to help our family, with an awareness of the dignity and nobility God granted it in creation.
One of the highlights of my work as a college president is commencement
while walking to the graduation ceremony, I was excited by the thought that our graduates were ready to go out to engage the world with the transforming power of the kingdom of Christ
On my way, I noticed some industrious ants busily going about their routine
I thought, There are much greater things happening than the building of sand piles
It's easy for us to get lost in 'ant world'?, to be so busy with our routines that we miss the joy of personally embracing the bigger picture of God's great work around the world
The work of the Spirit is sweeping across South America, thousands in Africa are coming to know Christ daily, persecuted Christians are thriving, and the Asian Rim is throbbing with the pulse of the gospel
Do those thoughts ever capture your heart
Your prayer life
Your checkbook
Our preoccupation with lesser things reminds me of Paul's report that 'Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world'
I wonder if Demas regretted abandoning the gospel for the sand piles of this world
Let's get out of 'ant world' and engage our hearts and lives in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, we were all overwhelmed by the images of devastation and hardship endured by the people of that tiny nation
Of the many heartbreaking pictures, one captured my attention
It showed a woman staring at the massive destruction, and weeping
Her mind could not process the suffering of her people, and as her heart was crushed, tears poured from her eyes
Her reaction was understandable
Sometimes crying is the only appropriate response to the suffering we encounter
As I examined that picture, I thought of the compassion of our Lord
Jesus understood the need for tears, and He too wept
But He wept over a different kind of devastation, the destruction brought on by sin
As He approached Jerusalem, marked by corruption and injustice and the pain they create, His response was tears
'Now as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it'
Jesus wept out of compassion and grief
As we encounter the inhumanity, suffering, and sin that wreak havoc in our world, how do we respond
If the heart of Christ breaks over the broken condition of our world, shouldn't ours
And shouldn't we then do everything we can to make a difference for those in need, both spiritually and physically?
When I was a kid, I had a hero: Pete Maravich, a high-scoring basketball player who handled the ball like a magician
Problem was, my desire to be like Pistol Pete blocked my satisfaction with who God made me to be
When I realized I could never play like Pete, I grew discouraged
I even quit my college team briefly because I couldn't measure up to the Maravich standard
Kids still do that kind of thing
They grow unhappy with who God made them to be because they measure themselves by their 'perfect' heroes
Christian singer Jonny Diaz recognized this and wrote a song called 'More Beautiful You.'
The song begins: 'Little girl fourteen flipping through a magazine; says she wants to look that way.'
Some young girls wish they could be like Disney star Selena Gomez or another star the way I wanted to be like Maravich
Diaz sings, 'There could never be a more beautiful you; don't buy the lies
you were made to fill a purpose that only you could do.'
Diaz is saying what another songwriter said under the inspiration of God thousands of years ago: '[We are] fearfully and wonderfully made'
God made us the way He wants us to be
Believe it
There could never be a more beautiful you.
One Sunday at the church where I pastor, I invited three children to find several scrolls with Bible verses written on them that I had hidden in our worship center
I told them that once they found them and read the words aloud, I would give them a prize
You should have seen those kids
They ran, moved chairs, and looked under plants and in purses
Their search for the scrolls was intense, but exciting
Their diligent search and subsequent discovery of the scrolls led to joy in the children, affirmation from our congregation, and a renewed sense of the importance of God's Word
In 2 Kings 22'\s23, we read how King Josiah and the people of Judah rediscovered the joy and importance of God's Word
During the repairing of the temple, Hilkiah the high priest found the Book of the Law
It must have been lost or hidden during the reign of Manasseh
Then when the scroll was read to King Josiah, he listened and responded to it
He sought further understanding of it , and he led the people to renew their commitment to its importance in their lives
Many today have unprecedented access to God's Word
Let's renew our commitment to 'find'
it every day and by our lives show its prominence.
Just before our church service began, I overheard a young man behind me talking with his mother
They were reading an announcement in the bulletin about a challenge to read one chapter of Proverbs each day for the months of July and August
He asked his mom, 'What will we do with chapter 31 in August since there are only 30 days?'
She said she thought there were 31 days in August
He responded, 'No, there are only 30.'
When it was time in the service to greet each other, I turned back toward him and said hello
Then I added, 'August does have 31 days.'
He insisted, No, it doesn't
There can't be 2 months in a row with 31 days.
The singing started, so I just smiled
This brief encounter made me think about our need to develop a teachable spirit, seeking wisdom beyond our own
In Proverbs 3, the attitude the father recommends to the son is one of humility: 'Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord'
In chapter 2, he says, 'Incline your ear to wisdom
; search for her as for hidden treasures'
Knowing whether August has 30 or 31 days doesn't matter much, but having a teachable spirit does
It will help us gain wisdom from God and others
Reading a chapter from Proverbs each day next month may give us a start.
The Ironman Triathlon consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run
It is not an easy feat for anyone to accomplish
But Dick Hoyt participated in the race and completed it with his physically disabled son Rick
When Dick swam, he pulled Rick in a small boat
When Dick cycled, Rick was in a seat-pod on the bike
When Dick ran, he pushed Rick along in a wheelchair
Rick was dependent on his dad in order to finish the race
He couldn't do it without him
We see a parallel between their story and our own Christian life
Just as Rick was dependent on his dad, we are dependent on Christ to complete our Christian race
As we strive to live a God-pleasing life, we realize that in spite of our best intentions and determination, we often stumble and fall short
By our strength alone, it is impossible
Oh, how we need the Lord's help
And it has been provided
Paul declares it with these insightful words, 'It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me
And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God'
We cannot finish the Christian race on our own
We have to do so by depending on Jesus living in us.
Are you part of the problem or part of the solution
Whether that question is posed during a business meeting, a church council, or a family discussion, it often springs from a sense of exasperation in trying to comprehend why someone has acted in a certain way
More often than not, the answer is a matter of perspective
If we had been among the Israelites leaving Egypt after 400 years of slavery, we would likely have seen Pharaoh as part of the problem, and he was
Yet God saw something more
Inexplicably, the Lord told Moses to take the people back toward Egypt and camp with their backs to the Red Sea 
So Pharaoh would attack them
The Israelites thought they were going to die, but God said that He would gain glory and honor for Himself through Pharaoh and all his army, 'and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord'
When we simply cannot understand why God allows circumstances that threaten to overwhelm us, it's good to remember that He has our good and His glory in mind
If we can say, 'Father, please enable me to trust and honor You in this situation,'
then we will be in concert with His perspective and plan.
We live in the woods, so we get very little prolonged sunlight in the summer
But we love fresh tomatoes, so I decided to try growing them in pots set in a few sunny spots
The plants started to grow right away and really fast
I was thrilled, until I realized that their fast growth was due to their efforts to reach out to the limited sunlight
By the time I figured out what was happening, the vines were too heavy to support themselves
I found some stakes, lifted the vines carefully, and fastened them in an upright position
Even though I tried to be gentle, one of the twisted vines broke when I tried to straighten it
This reminded me that discipline must begin before character is permanently bent and twisted
Eli the priest had two sons whom he failed to discipline
When their wickedness got so bad that he could no longer ignore it, he tried gentle rebuke
But it was too late, and God announced the dire consequences: 'I will judge [Eli's] house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them'
Being straightened out is painful, but being left crooked will ultimately hurt even more.
As a college student, I heard count- less engagement stories
My starry-eyed friends told about glitzy restaurants, mountaintop sunsets, and rides in horse-drawn carriages
I also recall one story about a young man who simply washed his girlfriend's feet
His 'modest proposal'
proved he understood that humility is vital for a lifelong commitment
The apostle Paul also understood the significance of humility and how it holds us together
This is especially important in marriage
Paul said to reject 'me-first'
urges: 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition'
Instead, we should value our spouses more than ourselves, and look out for their interests
Humility in action means serving our spouse, and no act of service is too small or too great
After all, Jesus 'humbled Himself
to the point of death, even the death of the cross'
His selflessness showed His love for us
What can you do today to humbly serve the one you love
Maybe it's as simple as leaving brussels sprouts off the dinner menu or as difficult as helping him or her through a long illness
Whatever it is, placing our spouse's needs before our own confirms our commitment to each other through Christlike humility.
Some years ago I came across a short essay written by Sir James Barrie, an English baron
In it he gives an intimate picture of his mother, who deeply loved God and His Word and who literally read her Bible to pieces
'It is mine now,'
Sir James wrote, 'and to me the black threads with which she stitched it are a part of the contents.'
My mother also loved God's Word
She read and pondered it for 60 years or more
I keep her Bible on my bookshelf in a prominent place
It too is tattered and torn, each stained page marked with her comments and reflections
As a boy, I often walked into her room in the morning and found her cradling her Bible in her lap, poring over its words
She did so until the day she could no longer see the words on the page
Even then her Bible was the most precious book in her possession
When Sir James' mother grew old, she could no longer read the words of her Bible
Yet daily, her husband put her Bible in her hands, and she would reverently hold it there
The psalmist wrote, 'How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth'
Have you tasted the goodness of the Lord
Open your Bible today
A TV program on the History Channel featured the world's most extreme airports
The one that caught my attention is no longer open, but it is one I had flown into
I agree that Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport was definitely a thrill ride for passengers and surely a challenge for pilots
If you came in from one direction, you had to fly over skyscrapers and then hope the plane stopped before it plunged into the sea
If you came in the other way, it seemed as if you were going to smack into a mountain
I found it surprising that a pilot who used to take planeloads of people into Kai Tak said, 'I miss flying into that airport.'
But I think I know what he meant
As a pilot, he relished the challenge
He had a confidence based on his ability and his reliance on those who guided him into the airport
Too often, we run from challenges
Yet the people we love to read about in the Bible are impressive because they battled challenges
Consider Paul
With the confidence of God's help, he faced troubles head-on, and conquered them
Christ's promise to Paul and to us is: 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness'
Like Paul's example, in the confidence of God's care we can say to the next challenge: Bring it on!
In the episodes of an old television show, the veteran police lieutenant always said this to the young officers on their way out to the street for their day's assignments: 'Be careful out there!'
It was both good advice and a word of compassion because he knew what could happen to them in the line of duty
Jesus gave His followers a similar warning, but in even stronger terms
Luke 11 ends ominously with these words: 'The scribes and the Pharisees began to assail Him vehemently, and to cross-examine Him about many things'
In the continuation of this account, Luke says that Jesus compassionately instructed His disciples to 'beware'
but not to worry or be afraid
Jesus was promising to guard, protect, and care for them as they went out into the world
He assured them that because He cared for simple things like birds and lilies, they could be certain that He would take care of His 'little flock' of believers
We cannot know the future
But we can know this: No matter what comes, we are under the loving, caring, watchful eye of our great Shepherd, who also happens to be the Son of God!
Some years ago when our children were still small, I flew home after a 10-day ministry trip
In those days people were allowed to visit the airport boarding area to greet incoming passengers
When my flight landed, I came out of the jet-bridge and was greeted by our little ones, so happy to see me that they were screaming and crying
I looked at my wife, whose eyes were teary
I couldn't speak
Strangers in the gate area also teared up as our children hugged my legs and cried their greetings
It was a wonderful moment
The memory of the intensity of that greeting serves as a gentle rebuke to the priorities of my own heart
The apostle John, eagerly desiring Jesus' return, wrote, 'He who testifies to these things says, '\sSurely I am coming quickly.' Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus!'
In another passage, Paul even spoke of a crown awaiting those who have 'loved His appearing'
Yet sometimes I don't feel as eager for Christ's return as my children were for mine
Jesus is worthy of the very best of our love and devotion, and nothing on earth should compare to the thought of seeing Him face-to-face
May our love for our Savior deepen as we anticipate our joyful reunion with Him.
A 47-year-old Austrian man gave away his entire $4.7 million fortune after concluding that his wealth and lavish spending were keeping him from real life and happiness
Karl Rabeder told the Daily Telegraph , 'I had the feeling I was working as a slave for things I did not wish for or need
It was the biggest shock in my life when I realized how horrible, soulless, and without feeling the '\sfive-star' lifestyle is.'
His money now funds charities he set up to help people in Latin America
Proverbs 4 urges us to consider carefully our own road in life
The passage contrasts the free, unhindered path of the just with the dark, confused way of the wicked
'Let your heart retain my words; keep my commands, and live'
'Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life'
'Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established'
Each verse encourages us to evaluate where we are in life
No one wants to go through life on a selfish, heartless road
But it can happen unless we consider where we are going in life and ask the Lord for His direction
May He give us grace today to embrace His Word and follow Him with all our hearts.
in the New Testament, did he call them saints because they were perfect
No
These people were human and therefore sinful
What then did he have in mind
The word saint in the New Testament means that one is set apart for God
It describes people who have a spiritual union with Christ
The word is synonymous with individual believers in Jesus and those who make up the church
Saints have a responsibility through the power of the Spirit to live lives worthy of their calling
This includes, but is not limited to, no longer being sexually immoral and using improper speech
We are to put on the new character traits of service to one another, humility, gentleness, patience, love, unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, obedience, and perseverance during hardship and suffering
In the Old Testament, the psalmist called saints 'the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight'
Our union with Christ makes us saints, but our obedience to God's Word through the power of the Holy Spirit makes us saintly.
Fault-finding is a popular pastime, and unfortunately a lot of us find it's easy to join the fun
Concentrating on the warts of others is a great way to feel better about ourselves
And that's just the problem
Avoiding the faults that need to be fixed in our own lives not only stunts our spiritual growth but also obstructs God's work through us
God's effectiveness through our lives is enhanced or hindered by the way we live
It's no wonder, then, that Paul made a concerted effort to 'put no obstacle in anyone's way'
For him there was nothing more important than his usefulness for Christ in the lives of others
Anything that got in the way of that was dispensable
If you want to be authentic and useful for God, take an obstacle inventory
Sometimes obstacles are things that in and of themselves may be legitimate, yet in certain contexts may be inappropriate 
But sin is clearly obstructive to others
Gossip, slander, boasting, bitterness, greed, abuse, anger, selfishness, and revenge all close the hearts of those around us to the message of God through us
So, replace your faults with the winsome ways of Jesus
That will enable others to see your 'no-fault'
Savior more clearly.
Steven Wiltshire, who has been called 'the human camera,' has the amazing ability to recall tiny details about anything he has seen and then reproduce them in drawings
For example, after Steven was flown over the city of Rome, he was asked to draw the city center on blank paper
Astonishingly, he accurately reproduced from memory the winding streets, the buildings, the windows, and other details
Wiltshire's memory is remarkable
Yet there's another kind of memory that's even more amazing, and much more vital
Before Jesus' return to heaven, He promised His disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit to give them supernatural memory of what they had experienced: 'The Helper, the Holy Spirit
will bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you'
The disciples heard Christ's marvelous teachings
They heard Him command the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the dead to be raised
Yet when the Gospel writers recorded these events, their words were not the product of a gifted human memory
Their recollections came from a divine Helper who made sure they compiled a trustworthy record of Christ's life
Trust the Bible with confidence
It was written with guidance from the 'divine camera,' the Holy Spirit.
After a global financial crisis, the US government enacted stricter laws to protect people from questionable banking practices
Banks had to change some of their policies to comply
To notify me of such changes, my bank sent me a letter
But when I got to the end I had more questions than answers
The use of phrases like 'we may'
and 'at our discretion'
certainly didn't sound like anything I could depend on
In contrast, the Old Testament quotes God as saying 'I will' numerous times
God promises David: 'I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever'
No uncertainty in those words
Recognizing God's faithfulness to His promises, King Solomon says in his prayer of dedication for the temple: 'You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand'
Centuries later, the apostle Paul said that all of God's promises are 'yes'
in Christ
In a world of uncertainty, our trust is in a faithful God who will always keep His promises.
Do you have someone you could call in the middle of the night if you needed help
Bible teacher Ray Pritchard calls these people '2 a.m friends.'
If you have an emergency, this kind of friend would ask you two questions: 'Where are you?'
and 'What do you need?'
Friends like that are crucial during difficult times
Jonathan was that type of friend for David
Jonathan's father, King Saul, who was filled with envy at David's popularity and God's blessing on him, tried to kill him
David escaped and asked his friend for help
While David hid in the field, Jonathan sat at dinner with his father and quickly realized that Saul did indeed intend to kill David
Because of their deep friendship, Jonathan 'was grieved for David'
He warned him of his father's plan and told him he should leave
David recognized what a good friend he had in Jonathan
The Bible says they wept together, 'but David more so'
Their souls were 'knit' together
Do you have loving Christian friends you can count on in a crisis
You give them something to eat'
It's easy to miss those words from Jesus
A huge crowd had gathered to hear Him
Late in the day, the disciples got nervous and started pressing Him to send them away 'You give them something to eat!'
Jesus replied
Why would He say that
John 6:6 says He was testing them
Did He want to see if they would trust Him to perform a miracle
Maybe, but it seems more likely He wanted His disciples involved in caring for the crowd, to be hands-on in working with and for Him
He then blessed what they brought to Him, five loaves of bread and two fish, and performed the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000
I think Jesus uses those words with us too
A need pre-sents itself in the lives of those around us, and we bring it to Jesus in prayer 'You do something,'
Jesus often says, 'But, Lord, we don't have enough time or money or energy.'
We're wrong, of course
When Jesus asks us to get involved, He already knows how He will accomplish His work through us
What we need is faith and vision, the ability to see that God wants us to be His instruments, and that He will supply what we need.
Near one of the most majestic sites in God's nature is a botanical garden of awe-inspiring beauty
On the Canadian side of Niagara Falls is the Floral Showhouse
Inside the greenhouse is a vast array of beautiful flowers and exotic plants
In addition to the flora my wife and I observed, something else caught our attention, the wording of a plaque
It reads: 'Enter, friends, and view God's pleasant handiwork, the embroidery of earth.'
What a marvelous way to describe the way our Creator favored this globe with such jaw-dropping beauty
The 'embroidery of earth'
includes such far-ranging God-touches as the verdant rainforests of Brazil, the frigid beauty of Arctic Circle glaciers, the flowing wheat fields of the North American plains, and the sweeping reaches of the fertile Serengeti in Africa
These areas, like those described in Isaiah 41, remind us to praise God for His creative handiwork
Scripture also reminds us that the wonder of individual plants are part of God's work
From the rose to the lily to the myrtle, cypress, and pine , God colors our world with a splendorous display of beauty
Enjoy the wonder
And spend some time praising God for the 'embroidery of earth.'?
A friend sent me photographs of 20 beautiful churches in the world
Located as far apart as Iceland and India, each of them is architecturally unique
The most beautiful place of worship in Jeremiah's day was the temple in Jerusalem, which King Josiah had recently repaired and restored
The people were fixated on the magnificent building , and they foolishly thought that having the temple there meant that God would protect them from their enemies
Instead, Jeremiah pointed out the sin in their lives
God is not impressed by beautiful buildings constructed in His name if there is no inward beauty in the hearts of those who go there
He is not interested in an outward legalistic worship that is not matched by inward holiness
And it is wrong to think that God protects people just because of the religious things they do
Just because we're reading the Bible, praying, and fellowshiping with other believers doesn't mean that God is somehow then obligated to do something for us
He cannot be manipulated
The purpose of those external activities is to develop our relationship with the Lord and to help us live differently than those in the world around us.
When my wife and I were engaged, her dad gave us a special wedding present
As a watchmaker and jeweler, he made our wedding rings
To make my wedding band, Jim used gold scraps left over from resizing other rings, scraps that were seemingly without much value
But in the hands of this craftsman, those pieces became a thing of beauty that I cherish to this day
It is amazing what a master craftsman can do with what others might view as useless
That is also how God works in our lives
He is the greatest Master Craftsman of all, taking the wasted pieces and broken shards of our lives and restoring them to worth and meaning
The prophet Jeremiah described this when he compared God's work to that of a potter working clay: 'The vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make'
No matter what messes we have made of our lives, God can remold us into vessels that are good in His eyes
As we confess any sin and submit ourselves in obedience to His Word, we allow the Master to do His redemptive work in our lives
That is the only way for the pieces of our brokenness to be made whole and good once again.
A 60-year-old hotel in Kansas is being renovated into apartments
A rusty ship that is docked in Philadelphia is being restored and may become a hotel or a museum
Hangar 61, an admired piece of architecture at the old Stapleton Airport in Colorado, is being transformed into a church
Each structure had a specific use that is no longer viable
Yet someone was able to see promise and a new purpose in each one
If structures can find new life and purpose, why not people
Think about these men in the Bible whose lives took an unexpected direction
There was Jacob, who wrestled with the angel of the Lord ; Moses, who talked to a burning bush ; Paul, who was temporarily blinded
Their stories were different, but all had a change of purpose when their encounter with God sent them down a new path
We too may experience circumstances that change the course of our lives
But God reminds us of this: I loved you before you loved Me
I want to give you hope and a future
Give all your worries to Me because I care about you
As you cling to God's promises, ask Him to reveal new direction and purpose for your life.
Things were off to a great start for Jesus at the beginning of His ministry
In Matthew 3, He was baptized and heard the affirming words of His Father, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'
But then things took a turn for the worse
What happened next, Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, was not a mere coincidence
The Holy Spirit led Him into this face-off between the powers of heaven and hell
Thankfully, Jesus' victory in the face of temptation provides a great example when we find ourselves in the wilderness of Satan's sinister seductions
Notice that the tempter caught Jesus at a time when He was tired and hungry
Satan uses the same tactic with us
Waiting for those vulnerable moments, he lures us with the bait of seductive suggestions that offer quick relief and opportunities for self-advancement
When facing such challenges, it's important to follow Jesus' example' throw 'the Book' at Satan
Jesus responded to temptation by quoting Scripture: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God'
The Bible is full of verses about lust, greed, lying, and other sins
If we tuck them away in our memory, we can use them when under attack
It's our best chance for success!
My friend Jeff was asked by his daughter to officiate at her wedding
This would be a great joy as they traveled to an exotic and romantic location for the ceremony
But there was one major problem, because the wedding party was very small, Jeff would have to perform three separate roles that could be in conflict
He would be the officiating minister, the father of the bride, and the wedding photographer
Have you ever felt as if you were wearing too many hats
Jethro thought his son-in-law Moses was
Leading the Israelites, arbitrating personal disputes, and handing down legal judgments for a great multitude was taking its toll
Finally, Jethro approached Moses, telling him: 'This thing is too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself'
He wisely counseled Moses to delegate smaller disputes to other advisors and take the more challenging cases himself
Whether you're a mother with small children, an overwhelmed business executive, or an overworked church volunteer, you too can take a lesson from Moses
Why not prayerfully discern if there may be tasks you can delegate to others or even discontinue, so that you don't wear yourself out.
During a demonstration of sheep- herding using a Border Collie, the dog trainer explained that because sheep are highly vulnerable to wild animals, their main defense against predators is to stay together in a tightly knit group
'A sheep alone is a dead sheep,'
the trainer said
'The dog always keeps the sheep together as it moves them.'
The biblical image of God as our shepherd is a powerful reminder of how much we need each other in the community of faith
When writing about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the psalmist said, '[God] made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock; and He led them on safely, so that they did not fear'
As part of God's flock, we who have trusted Christ are under His guiding, protecting hand while being surrounded by the shielding presence of others
We are part of a larger body of believers in which there is safety and accountability
While we don't give up our personal responsibility for thought and action as members of the flock, we are to embrace the concept of 'we'
rather than 'me'
in our daily lives
With Christ as our Shepherd and fellow believers around us, we find safety in the flock.
I have a good friend I fish with now and then
He's a very thoughtful man
After climbing into his waders and boots and gathering up his gear, he sits on the tailgate of his truck and scans the river for 15 minutes or more, looking for rising fish
'No use fishing where they ain't,' he says
This makes me think of another question: 'Do I fish for souls where they ain't?'
It was said of Jesus that He was 'a friend of tax collectors and sinners'
As Christians, we are to be unlike the world in our behavior, but squarely in it as He was
So we have to ask ourselves: Do I, like Jesus, have friends who are sinners
If I have only Christian friends, I may be fishing for souls 'where they ain't.'
Being with nonbelievers is the first step in 'fishing.'
Then comes love, a heart-kindness that sees beneath the surface of their off-hand remarks and listens for the deeper cry of the soul
It asks, 'Can you tell me more about that?'
pastor George Herbert said, 'There is much preaching in this friendliness,'
Such love is not a natural instinct, it comes solely from God
And so we pray: 'Lord, when I am with nonbelievers today, may I become aware of the cheerless voice, the weary countenance, or the downcast eyes that I, in my natural self-preoccupation, could easily overlook
May I have a love that springs from and is rooted in Your love
May I listen to others, show Your compassion, and speak Your truth today.'?
I discovered rather quickly that a young boy quoting Scripture in a children's program at church didn't know much about the Bible
He was quoting Ephesians 6:17 from our study on spiritual armor: 'Take
the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.'
When he tried quoting the reference, he said, 'I didn't think I needed to memorize the numbers, since that's just the time of day.'
That's what he thought the numbers meant since it was close to 6:17 p.m at the time
I smiled, opened my Bible, and showed him that the numbers refer to the chapter and verse
While knowing the Bible reference is helpful, hiding God's Word in our hearts is what is truly important
Memorizing Scripture allows us to have it in mind so we can ward off Satan's attacks
For instance, when the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness, Christ withstood him by quoting the Scriptures
Likewise, when we are tempted to disobey God, we can recall what we've learned and choose to obey
We can also share the teachings of the Word with others to encourage them to trust Him too
No matter what time of day it is, we should always take the spiritual armor of the Word of God with us.
Toni was looking for what wasn't really lost, and she found what she wasn't looking for
As a result, a group of people got a spiritual boost they weren't expecting
Toni, who conducts a Bible study in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Alaska, was looking for her husband's missing driver's license
As she retraced his steps from the previous day, she visited a hospital
The missing license wasn't there, but a Christian high school chorale was, and Toni was touched by their worshipful singing
She asked the director if the teens could sing for her Bible-study group that evening
They could, and they did, bringing hope, joy, and God's love through music and post-concert conversation to some folks trying to put their lives back together
Oh, and that driver's license
Toni found it on a chair when she got back home
Apparently, the only reason she went out that day was so God could direct her to hear a bunch of teens who could minister to her rehab group
When God guides us , He works in ways we can't predict
He can use even our inconveniences to bring honor to His name
When we face a seeming nuisance in our day, perhaps we should look not just for what we think we want but also for what God has for us that day.
When our youngest son joined the Army, we knew that challenges lay ahead
We knew that he would face danger and be tested physically, emotionally, and spiritually
We also knew that in some ways our home would never fully be his home again
In the months leading up to his departure, my wife and I steeled ourselves for these challenges
Then the day came when Mark had to report
We hugged and said our goodbyes, and then he walked into the recruiting station, leaving me with a moment for which I was decidedly unprepared
The pain of that hard goodbye felt unbearable
At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I can't remember when I have wept as hard as I did that day
The hard goodbye, and the sense of loss it delivered, cut me to the heart
In such moments, I am thankful to have a heavenly Father who knows what it is to be separated from a beloved Son
I am thankful to have a God who is described as 'a father of the fatherless, a defender of widows'
I believe that if He cares for the orphaned and the widows in their loneliness, He will also care for me and comfort me, even in those moments when I face the struggles that accompany hard goodbyes.
Jerry McMorris began reading the Wall Street Journal 50 years ago as a student at the University of Colorado
His appreciation for that publication and for his alma mater led him to donate hundreds of WSJ subscriptions for CU's business school students
McMorris told the Colorado Springs Gazette: 'The Journal gave me a good, broad perspective of what was going on in the business world, and I got into the habit of reading it at the start of my business day
It helps get across to students real business-world issues.'
Many people enjoy introducing others to the writings that have shaped their lives
It's not surprising, then, that followers of Christ enjoy sharing God's Word with others
Some support Bible translation and distribution while others invite friends to study the Word with them
There are many ways to pass along God's truth to people hungering for encouragement and help
Our goal is to enable others to experience the great benefit we've found in knowing Christ and being guided by His Word
The psalmist said, 'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple'
The Word of God, which guards our hearts and guides our steps, is worth sharing with others.
Sometimes I am ashamed of my prayers
Too often I hear myself using familiar phrases that are more like mindless filler than thoughtful, intimate interaction
One phrase that annoys me, and that I think might offend God, is 'Lord, be with me.'
In Scripture, God has already promised not to leave me
God made this promise to Joshua just before he led the Israelites into the Promised Land
The author of Hebrews later claimed it for all believers: 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
In both cases, the context indicates that God's presence has to do with giving us the power to carry out His will, not our own will, which is generally what I have in mind in my prayers
Perhaps a better prayer would be something like this: 'Lord, thank You for Your indwelling Spirit who is willing and able to direct me in the ways You want me to go
May I not take You where You don't want to go
May I not enlist You to do my will, but humbly submit to doing Yours.'
When we are doing God's will, He will be with us even without our asking
If we're not doing His will, we need to ask for His forgiveness, change our course, and follow Him.
A few years ago I had some tests to screen for cancer, and I was nervous about the outcome
My anxiety was magnified as I thought about the fact that while the medical personnel were well-trained and extremely competent, they were also strangers who had no relationship with me
After awakening from the anesthesia, however, I heard the beautiful sound of my wife's voice: 'It's great, Honey
They didn't find anything.'
I looked up at her smiling face and was comforted
I needed the assurance of someone who loved me
A similar assurance lies ahead for all who have trusted Jesus
Believers can be comforted in knowing that when they wake up in heaven, One who loves them greatly, Jesus, will be there
The Book of Common Prayer expresses this Christian hope: 'After my awakening, [my Redeemer] will raise me up; and in my body I shall see God
I myself shall see, and eyes behold Him who is my friend and not a stranger.'
Do you have trouble facing mortality
Jesus promised to be there when we slip from this world into the next
He said, 'Where I am [heaven], there you may be also'
What a comfort for believers to know that after death we will be awakened by a close Friend.
Someone once said, 'The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow
Do good anyway.'
I like that; it's a great reminder
In the book of Acts, Luke summarized Jesus' earthly ministry by saying that He 'went about doing good'
What does the Bible mean when it tells us to 'do good'?
Jesus did good by teaching, healing, feeding, and comforting people
Using Jesus as the perfect example, His followers are called to meet the needs of others, including those who hate them: 'Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you'
They are to serve their enemies without expecting anything in return
Moreover, as opportunity arises, His followers are to do good especially to fellow believers
They are not to let persecution, selfishness, and busyness cause them to forget to do good and to share what they have with others
To be like our Savior and His early followers, we should ask ourselves each day: 'What good thing can I do today in Jesus' name?'
When we do good, we will be offering a sacrifice that pleases God and that draws people to Him .
In an effort to assist people struggling to provide for their families during tough economic times, the church I attend created a program called 'Free 4 All.'
We brought lightly used items to the church and opened the doors to people of the community
They could come and take home anything they needed
While the day was a huge success as far as the amount of goods people were able to pick up, it was even better for this reason: Six people trusted Jesus Christ as Savior at the event
The items that were taken to the church on this special day had already been purchased
They were then given without cost to all who simply asked for them
Likewise, eternal forgiveness for our sins has already been purchased
Jesus paid that price when He died on a cross on Golgotha's hill 2,000 years ago
He now offers salvation at no cost to all who simply repent and believe that Jesus has the power to forgive and save
Each of us is needy spiritually, and only Jesus can meet that need
One day I bought an inexpensive model of the solar system for my son
Installing it required me to suspend each planet from the ceiling
After bending up and down several times, I was lightheaded and tired
Hours later, we heard a 'plink' as Jupiter hit the floor
Later that night, I thought about how our flimsy replica fell apart, yet Jesus sustains the actual universe
'He is before all things, and in Him all things consist'
The Lord Jesus holds our world together, maintaining the natural laws that rule the galaxy
Our Creator also upholds 'all things by the word of His power'
Jesus is so mighty that He keeps the universe in order simply by commanding it to be so
As amazing as this is, Jesus is more than a cosmic caretaker
He sustains us too
He 'gives life and breath to everything, and He satisfies every need'
While Jesus sometimes provides for us differently than we might expect, our Savior keeps us going whether we are brokenhearted, in need of money, or enduring illness
Until the day He calls us home, we can trust that the One who keeps Jupiter from falling is the One who holds us up as well.
Philosophers ponder, 'What is the good life and who has it?'
I instantly think of my good friend Roy
Roy was a gentle, quiet man who sought no recognition, who left the care of his life to his heavenly Father, and who occupied himself solely with his Father's will
His was a heavenly perspective as he often reminded me: 'We are but sojourners here.'
Roy passed away last fall
At his memorial service, friends reminisced over his influence on their lives
Many spoke of his kindness, selfless giving, humility, and gentle compassion
He was, for many, a visible expression of God's unconditional love
After the service, Roy's son drove to the assisted-living facility where his father lived out his final days
He gathered up his dad's belongings: two pairs of shoes, a few shirts and pants, and a few odds and ends, the sum of Roy's earthly goods, and delivered them to a local charity
Roy never had what some would consider the good life, but he was rich toward God in good deeds
George MacDonald wrote, 'Which one is the possessor of heaven and earth: He who has a thousand houses, or he who, with no house to call his own, has ten at which his knock arouses instant jubilation?'
Roy's was the good life after all.
A couple of years ago in our church we did a sermon series on the Old Testament tabernacle
Leading up to the message on the table of showbread, I did something I had never done before, I fasted from food for several days
I fasted because I wanted to experience the truth that 'man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord'
I wanted to deny myself something I love, food, for the God I love more
As I fasted, I followed Jesus' teaching about fasting in Matthew 6:16-18
Jesus gave a negative command: 'When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance'
Then He gave a positive command about putting oil on your head and washing your face
The two commands taken together meant that they should not draw attention to themselves
Jesus was teaching that this was a private act of sacrificial worship that should not provide any room for religious pride
Finally, He gave a promise: Your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
Although fasting isn't required, in giving up something we love, we may have a deeper experience of the God we love
He rewards us with Himself.
While traveling in a foreign country, my husband noticed that the paved roads had deep indentations
When he asked about them, our driver explained that they were caused by the tires of trucks carrying illegal, overweight loads
When stopped by police, the drivers paid bribes to avoid being fined
The truckers and police officers came out ahead financially, but other drivers and taxpayers were left with an unfair financial burden and the inconvenience of poor roads
Not all bribery is overt; some is more subtle
And not all bribes are financial
Flattery is a type of bribe that uses words as currency
If we give people preferential treatment for saying something nice about us, it's similar to taking a bribe
To God, any kind of partiality is an injustice
He even made justice a condition of remaining in the Promised Land
The Israelites were not to pervert justice or show partiality
Bribery deprives others of justice, which is an offense against the character of God, who is 'God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe'
Thankfully, the Lord treats all of us alike, and He wants us to treat each other the same way.
Angie could not see through the fogged-up windows in her car
Inadvertently, she pulled out in front of a truck
The accident caused such damage to her brain that she could no longer speak or take care of herself
Over the years, I have been amazed at the resiliency of Angie's parents
Recently I asked them, 'How have you managed to get through this experience?'
Her father thoughtfully responded, 'In all honesty, the only way we have been able to do this is by drawing close to God
He gives us the strength we need to help us through.'
Angie's mother agreed and added that around the time of the accident their grieving was so deep that they wondered if they would ever have joy again
As they both leaned upon God, they experienced countless unexpected provisions for the physical and spiritual care of Angie and their entire family
Although Angie may never regain her ability to speak, she now responds to them with wide smiles and this gives them joy
Her parents' favorite verse continues to be: 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning'
Have you experienced extreme sorrow
There is the promise of future joy amid your tears as you lean upon our loving Lord.
I always look forward to summer
The warm sunshine, baseball, beaches, and barbecues are pleasures that bring joy after a long, cold winter
But pleasure-seeking isn't just seasonal
Don't we all enjoy good food, engaging conversation, and a crackling fire
The desire for pleasure isn't wrong
God has built us for it
Paul reminds us that God 'gives us richly all things to enjoy'
Other passages welcome us to the healthy pleasure of food, friends, and the intimacy of a marriage relationship
But thinking that we can find lasting pleasure in people and things is ultimately an empty pursuit
Ultimate pleasure is not found in the short-lived thrills our world offers, but rather in the long-term joy from a deepening intimacy with our Lord
King Solomon learned this the hard way
'I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,'
he admitted
But after his pleasure-seeking spree, he concluded: 'All was vanity and grasping for the wind'
It's no wonder he warned, 'He who loves pleasure will be a poor man'
What we are really looking for is satisfied only in a fulfilling and growing relationship with Jesus
Pursue Him and taste His delights!
My friend and I were traveling together, and she seemed a bit frazzled
When we got to the airport, she forgot to have her identification readily available and couldn't find her reservation confirmation number
The ticket agent waited patiently, smiled, and then helped her at the check-in
After receiving her ticket, she asked, 'Where do we go next?'
The agent smiled again, pointed at me, and said to her, 'Stay close to your friend.'
That can be good advice for all of us when our lives get frazzled, stay close to your friends
Although Jesus is our best friend, we also need relationships with fellow believers to help us survive in this life
In his first epistle, Peter was writing to believers who needed one another because they were suffering for their faith
In a few short sentences in chapter 4, Peter mentioned the need to receive and give 'fervent love,'
prayer, and hospitality
He also included the need for believers to use their spiritual gifts to minister to one another
In other passages, we're encouraged to comfort each other with the comfort we've been given by God and to build each other up in love
When life gets difficult and we get frazzled, staying close to our Christian friends will help us to get through.
From my home in Colorado, I recently used Google Maps to 'wander around'
the neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya, where my family lived 2 decades ago
A satellite image on my computer screen enabled me to identify roads, landmarks, and buildings
In some cases, I got a street-level view, as if I were standing on the ground there
It was quite a view, but only a small taste of how the Lord must see our world
The psalmist celebrated God's view by writing these words: 'The Lord looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men
He considers all their works
The eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine'
Unlike an unfeeling satellite, the Lord sees with His heart of love as He considers who we are and what we do
The Bible reveals that He longs for us to trust Him and follow His way
We are never out of God's sight, and He keeps a close eye on everyone whose hope is in Him
For all who know the Lord through faith in Jesus Christ, it's encouraging to realize that every day we're part of His amazing view.
I took the bait
At first, we traded one-liners aimed at goading the other or scoring points
Gradually, though, bits and pieces of our respective life stories started creeping into the discussion
Curiosity got the better of both of us and we found ourselves asking questions instead of feuding
A political science major in college and a political junkie by hobby, I was intrigued with his career, which included two prominent ambassadorships
Strangely enough, his questions to me were about my faith
How I became 'a believer'
was what interested him most
The train ride ended amicably, and we even traded business cards
As he left the train, he turned to me and said, 'By the way, the best part of your argument isn't what you think Jesus can do for me
It's what He's done for you.'
In John 9, as on that train, God reminds us that the best story is the one we know intimately: Our own encounter with Jesus Christ
Practice telling your story of faith to loved ones and close friends so you'll be able to tell it clearly to others.
For a good portion of my life, I shared the perspective of those who rail against God for allowing pain
I could find no way to rationalize a world as toxic as this one
As I visited people whose pain far exceeded my own, though, I was surprised by its effects
Suffering seemed as likely to reinforce faith as to sow doubt
My anger about pain has melted mostly for one reason: I have come to know God
He has given me joy and love and happiness and goodness
It leaves me with faith in a Person, a faith so solid that no amount of suffering can erode it
Where is God when it hurts
He has been there from the beginning
He designed a pain system that, in the midst of a fallen world, bears His stamp
He transforms pain, using it to teach and strengthen us if we allow it to turn us toward Him
He has hurt and bled and cried and suffered
He has dignified for all time those who suffer, by sharing their pain
But one day He will gather the armies of heaven and will unleash them against the enemies of God
The world will see one last terrifying moment of suffering before the full victory is ushered in
Then God will create for us a new, incredible world and pain will be no more .
England's Imperial War Museum is housed in a building in London that was a former location of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, a care center for the mentally ill
The hospital was commonly known as 'Bedlam,'
which gradually became a term used to describe scenes of chaos and madness
It's ironic that the War Museum would occupy Bedlam's former location
As you walk through the museum, in addition to stories of heroism and sacrifice in wartime, you also find bone-chilling accounts of the madness of man's inhumanity to man
From the exhibits about modern genocide and ethnic cleansing to the one on the Holocaust, it is evil on display
Solomon observed mankind's propensity for evil, describing it as those who 'rejoice in doing evil, and delight in the perversity of the wicked'
While this may describe much of the world around us, followers of Jesus have a refreshingly different way to handle life
Paul challenged us: 'Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good'
Christ-centered actions such as living morally , making peace , and treating our enemies with care will affect the world for good
If each of us were to live as a reflection of God's love, perhaps there would be a lot less bedlam.
If you're a fan of Shakespeare, you know that his heroes always have a serious character flaw
It makes for a good story and teaches some important lessons
The same is true of our Bible hero Abraham
His flaw
Fear
Twice Abraham succumbed to his fear that a ruler would kill him and steal his wife
Fearing for his life, he deceived both Pharaoh and King Abimelech by saying, 'She is my sister'?, in essence welcoming the king to take Sarah into his harem
With fear dictating his actions, he put at risk God's plan that through him and Sarah a great nation would arise
But before we judge Abraham, we should ask ourselves a few questions
For fear of losing our job, would we compromise our integrity
For fear of appearing old-fashioned, would we set aside our values
For fear of being ridiculed or misunderstood, would we neglect sharing the gospel and put someone's eternity at risk
Only one thing will conquer our fears: tenacious faith in God's presence, protection, power, and promises
If your fear is putting God's wonderful plans for you at risk, remember that He will never ask you to do anything He can't bring to completion, even if it requires miraculous intervention on His part.
The psalmist was fed up with 'the contempt of the proud'
Perhaps you are too
People in your neighborhood, office, or classroom may be scornful of your faith and determination to follow Jesus
Sticks and stones do break our bones, but words can wound more deeply
In his commentary on this psalm, Derek Kidner refers to contempt as 'cold steel.'
We can fend off the jeers of the proud by becoming like them, or we can view their attempt to humiliate us as a badge of honor
We can rejoice that we've been 'counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus name'
Better to bear shame for a short time than to endure 'everlasting contempt'
We must not be like the mockers by mocking them in turn, but bless those who persecute us
'Bless and do not curse,'
Paul reminds us
Then God may draw them to faith and repentance, and turn our moments of shame into eternal glory
Finally, as the psalmist counsels us, we must 'look to the Lord our God'
He understands as no other, for He too has endured reproach
He will show compassion to us according to His infinite mercy.
Too long
Too short
Too big
Too small
Too tight
Too loose
These words describe most of the clothes I try on
Finding the perfect fit seems impossible
Finding a church that is a 'perfect fit'
poses similar problems
Every church has something that's not quite right
Certain attitudes, beliefs, people, or programs make us uncomfortable
We feel as if we don't fit
We struggle to find our place
We know, however, that God wants us to fit together with one another
The apostle Paul said we are being 'built together to become a dwelling in which God lives'
The believers in the church today, like the tabernacle in the days of Moses and the temple in the days of Solomon , are the dwelling place of God on earth
God wants us to fit together, for there to be no divisions in His church
This means that we, the building blocks, are to be 'perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment'
No church will be a perfect fit, but we can all work at fitting together more perfectly.
What a rotten design,'
I grumbled, as I emptied our paper shredder
I was following good advice about shredding personal documents, but I could not empty the container without spilling strips of confetti all over the carpet
One day as I was gathering trash, I debated whether I'd even bother since it was only half-full
But when I slipped a small plastic bag over the top and flipped it upside down, I was pleased to see that not a bit of paper had fallen on the floor
The error had been mine
I had been waiting until the container was filled to the brim before emptying it
When we allow sin to fill up our hearts, it too will overflow into our life
Luke 6:45 says that 'an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil.'
What if we were to empty our hearts of the rubbish of sin before it started spilling into our interactions with others
To dispose of our bitterness, stubborn pride, seething anger
First John 1:9 reminds us that 'if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'
A paper shredder is designed to be a rubbish receptacle
You and I are not!
If a player's ball goes out-of-bounds, a one-stroke penalty is imposed
The prophet Jeremiah warned the southern kingdom of Judah about their persistent rejection of God's boundaries for them
Yet, the Lord's people had defiant and rebellious hearts
There was no fear of God, who gave them rain for their crops
They grew rich on deceit and ignored the pleas of the disadvantaged
God has given moral boundaries in His Word for us to live within
He gave them not to frustrate us but so that by keeping within them we may enjoy His blessings
David wrote: 'I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right'
God told Israel through Moses, 'I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life'
On February 1, 1960, four students from an all-black college sat down at a 'whites only' lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina
One of them, Franklin McCain, noticed an older white woman seated nearby looking at them
He was sure that her thoughts were unkind toward them and their protest against segregation
A few minutes later she walked over to them, put her hands on their shoulders, and said, 'Boys, I am so proud of you.'
Recalling the event years later on National Public Radio, McCain said he learned from this never to stereotype anyone
Instead he should pause to consider others and seek an opportunity to talk with them
The first-century church, like ours today, was often fractured by divisions based on race, language, and culture
Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in Corinth to help them respond to those who were more concerned with outward appearance than with what is in the heart
Because Christ died for all, Paul said, 'From now on, we regard no one according to the flesh'
May we all look closely to see the person inside, for everyone is made in the image of God and can become a new creation in Christ.
Celebrating my 60th birthday really changed my perspective on life,  I used to think people in their sixties were 'old.'
Then I started counting the number of productive years I might have left and set the number at 10
I went along with this dead-end kind of thinking until I remembered a very productive co-worker who was 85
So I sought him out to ask what life after 60 was like
He told me of some of the wonderful ministry opportunities the Lord had given him over the last 25 years
The apostle Paul, referring to himself as 'aged'
in Philemon 1:9, really resonates with my own sense of aging: 'Being such a one as Paul, the aged'
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus'
Paul was asking Philemon to take back his runaway servant Onesimus
Some scholars believe Paul was in his late forties or early fifties when he wrote this, certainly not a senior citizen by today's standards
But life expectancy in those days was much shorter
Yet despite awareness of his mature years, Paul went on to serve the Lord for several more years
While we may experience physical or other kinds of limitations, what really matters is that we continue doing what we can for the Lord until He calls us Home.
As we hurtle through the first part of this new century, we see an increase in people questioning time-honored standards
This was plainly detailed recently by a teen pop star, a girl who professes faith in Jesus
While discussing standards for modesty in how she dresses, she discounted criticism of her skimpy clothing by saying, 'That's so old school.'
This young woman is both right and wrong
In a sense, she's right
The standards of dress for Christians are 'old school.'
They were written down more than 2,000 years ago
But her attitude that suggests ancient standards can be set aside is wrong
In the truest sense, the principles in the Bible are not 'old'
While written ages ago, they are still fresh and applicable
As to the question of modesty, when the Bible says women should 'adorn themselves in modest apparel'
it is still true today that we shouldn't dress to draw attention to ourselves
A more general principle, 'Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed'
is a 2011 command that can guide the question of how we dress
So whether you're a pop star or a pew sitter, don't worry about being 'old school' if what you are doing is done according to the Book.
My occupation is words
Whether I am writing or editing, I am using words to convey ideas so that readers can understand
I can usually see what's wrong with someone else's writing and figure out how to fix it
As an editor, I am paid for being critical
My job is to see what's wrong with the way words are used
This ability becomes a disability when I carry it over into my personal life and always look for what is wrong
Focusing on what's wrong can cause us to miss everything that's good
The apostle Paul had reason to focus on what was wrong in the Philippian church
Certain people were preaching the gospel out of selfish ambition to add to Paul's suffering
But instead of concentrating on the negative, he chose to look at the positive and rejoice in it: Jesus Christ was being preached
God wants us to be discerning, we need to know good from bad, but He doesn't want us to focus on the bad and become critical or discouraged
Even in circumstances that are less than ideal , we can find something good because in times of trouble God is still at work.
Inevitably, trouble will invade our lives
A bad report from a medical test, the betrayal of a trusted friend, a child who rejects us, or a spouse who leaves us
The list of possibilities is long, but there are only two options: forge ahead on our own, or turn to God
Flying solo into the face of trouble is not a good idea
It can lead to bad behavior patterns, blaming God, and retreating into defeat
Like the Israelites, we may spin out of control and into despair
When the majority of the spies brought a report of intimidating giants and dangers ahead, they used the pronoun 'we'
The Israelites were on the cusp of the ultimate blessing that God promised to them
They were eyewitnesses to the miracles in Egypt and their feet had walked the dry bottom of the Red Sea in jaw-dropping victory
God's faithfulness had been amazingly evident
What short memories
What disappointing faithlessness
Sadly, they turned their backs on God and left the blessing behind
Caleb and Joshua, on the other hand, opted to turn to the Lord with this confidence: 'The Lord is with us'
When your giants show up, what will you do?
For the past 29 years, the annual Celebration of Life reunion in our city has brought together members of a unique family
The festive gathering reunites doctors, nurses, and staff from Colorado Springs' Memorial Hospital for Children with former patients from its neonatal intensive care unit
Some are infants in strollers while others are young teens
Their parents have come with them to say thank you to those who saved their children's lives and gave them a second chance
Edward Paik's article in The Gazette quoted Dr
Bob Kiley's heartfelt response: 'Both professionally and personally, for all the staff, this solidifies why we're in this job.'
I wonder if in heaven there will be many such times when spiritual caregivers and those they helped as 'babes in Christ'
will reunite to share stories and give praise to God
The New Testament describes how Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy worked among the young believers in Thessalonica with gentleness, 'just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children'
and with comfort and encouragement, 'as a father does his own children'
Helping new believers at a critical stage in their faith is a labor of love that will be cause for great rejoicing at the 'family'
reunion in heaven.
I wear only two pieces of jewelry: a wedding band on my finger and a small Celtic cross on a chain around my neck
The ring represents my vow to be faithful to Carolyn, my wife, as long as I shall live
The cross reminds me that it is not for her sake alone, but for Jesus' sake that I do so
He has asked me to be faithful to her until death shall separate us
A marriage vow is more than a contract that we can break by paying damages
It is a unique vow that is explicitly intended to be binding until death separates us
The words 'for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness and in health'
take into consideration the probability that it will not be easy to keep our vows
Circumstances may change and so may our spouses
Marriage is hard at best; disagreements and difficult adjustments abound
While no one must live in an abusive and dangerous relationship, accepting the difficulties of poverty, hardship, and disappointment can lead to happiness
A marriage vow is a binding obligation to love, honor, and cherish one another for as long as we shall live because Jesus has asked us to do so
As a friend of mine once put it, 'This is the vow that keeps us faithful even when we don't feel like keeping our vows.'
Yves Rossy accomplished something people have dreamed of since the ancient myth of Icarus
He has flown
Known as the 'Fusion Man,'
Rossy built a set of wings with an engine pack that uses his body as the fuselage of the aircraft, with the wings fused to the back of his heat-resistant suit
His first flight took place near Geneva, Switzerland, in 2004, and he has since had numerous successful flights
The psalmist David longed to have wings so he could fly away
In a time when he was being pursued by enemies who were seeking to take his life, Israel's king cried, 'Oh, that I had wings like a dove, I would fly away and be at rest'
Like David, when we're facing pressure, mistreatment, hardship, or grief, we might wish we could sprout wings and fly away
But Jesus offers a better way
Rather than fleeing our struggles, He invites us to flee to Him
He said, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me,
and you will find rest for your souls'
Rather than wishing we could fly away and escape life's problems, we can bring them to Him
Escape cannot give us rest, but Jesus can.
My friend Dan, who was soon to graduate from high school, was required to make a senior presentation
He had 15 minutes to share how he had made it to the point of graduation and to thank those who had helped him along the way
I gazed around the room before he started to talk
All kinds of people, young families, teachers, friends, church leaders, and coaches, were in attendance
He began to talk about the ways each person had touched his life
One woman had 'been like an aunt and had always been there' for him
A 30-something man shared Scriptures often and gave counsel.
Another man had taught him discipline and hard work.
A church friend had taken him to football practice every day because his mom couldn't
A couple had treated him like he was their own son.
One commonality, they were all just ordinary Christians who had reached out to make a difference in his life
Paul called it doing 'good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith'
We can help shape another person's life by showing an interest and taking action
And, as happened with Dan, we can reap a harvest
Look around
Is there someone whose life needs your touch?
Someone has defined friendship as 'knowing the heart of another and sharing one's heart with another.'
We share our hearts with those we trust, and trust those who care about us
We confide in our friends because we have confidence that they will use the information to help us, not harm us
They in turn confide in us for the same reason
We often refer to Jesus as our friend because we know that He wants what is best for us
We confide in Him because we trust Him
But have you ever considered that Jesus confides in His people
Jesus began calling His disciples friends rather than servants because He had entrusted them with everything He had heard from His Father
Jesus trusted the disciples to use the information for the good of His Father's kingdom
Although we know that Jesus is our friend, can we say that we are His friends
Do we listen to Him
Or do we only want Him to listen to us
Do we want to know what's on His heart
Or do we only want to tell Him what's on ours
To be a friend of Jesus, we need to listen to what He wants us to know and then use the information to bring others into friendship with Him.
A case before the US Supreme Court focused on whether a religious symbol, specifically a cross, should be allowed on public land
Mark Sherman, writing for the Associated Press, said that although the cross in question was erected in 1934 as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I, one veteran's group that opposed it called the cross 'a powerful Christian symbol'
and 'not a symbol of any other religion.'
The cross has always been controversial
In the first century, the apostle Paul said that Christ had sent him 'to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God'
As followers of Christ, we see the cross as more than a powerful Christian symbol
It is the evidence of God's power to free us from the tyranny of our sin
In a diverse and pluralistic society, the controversy over religious symbols will continue
Whether a cross can be displayed on public property will likely be determined by the courts
But displaying the power of the cross through our lives will be decided in our hearts.
Early in the spring, my wife and I watched a fascinating bird show outside our kitchen window
A couple of blackbirds with straw in their beaks entered a small vent in the house next door
A couple of weeks later, to our delight, we saw four baby birds stick their heads out of the vent
Mom and Dad took turns feeding their hungry babies
Seeing the babies' wide-open mouths reminded me of how important it is for followers of Christ to eagerly desire spiritual food
In 1 Peter 2:2, the apostle Peter uses the analogy of babies longing to be fed: 'As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.'
The Greek word translated 'desire'
speaks of an intense yearning
It is a compound word meaning to 'earnestly desire'
or to 'long after.'
It might seem strange to be commanded to earnestly long for something
But unlike hungry birds and babies, we need to be reminded of our need for spiritual nourishment
Even though we may have fed on the Word in the past , we need to realize that our need is ongoing and that without more nourishment we will grow spiritually weak
God is eager to feed His dear children
So, open wide!
While staying at our house for a while, my granddaughter Addie began asking, 'Whatcha doin' Grandpa?'
over and over
Whether I was working at my computer, putting on my shoes to go outside, sitting down to read, or helping in the kitchen, she sidled up to me and asked what I was doing
After answering her a few dozen times with, 'Paying bills,'
'Going to the store,'
'Reading the paper,'
'Helping Grandma,'
I came to the conclusion that she was asking a key question
Answering to a curious little girl about everything we do is one thing, but answering to God about our actions is infinitely more important
Wouldn't it be helpful to think of God coming alongside us at any time to ask, 'What are you doing?'
Imagine how often our answers would seem meaningless or empty
'I'm spending the entire evening watching TV.'
'I'm eating more food than I should.'
'I'm going another day without talking to You.'
'I'm arguing with my spouse.'
The list could go on, to our embarrassment
We are told to use our time carefully, with God's glory in sight
Paul said, 'Be very careful, then, how you live'
So, it's a good question
God wants to know: 'Whatcha doin'?'?
We live in an age dominated by all kinds of public opinion polls
Decisions are being driven by the crowd, and some of that is good
Surveys can inform us about people's experiences with products, helping us make wiser purchases
Opinion polls can give government officials a sense of how their policy initiatives will be received
While information gleaned is a matter of personal opinion, it can be helpful in shaping decision-making on a variety of levels
But when it comes to the most important question for all eternity, a public opinion poll cannot give us the answer
We must answer for ourselves
In Matthew 16, Jesus took His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked a question about public opinion: 'Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?'
The answers were varied, and all were complimentary, but none was adequate
That's why Jesus then asked His disciples, 'But who do you say that I am?'
Peter got the answer right: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
Public opinion can help answer certain questions, but not the one question that will determine your eternity: Who do you say that Jesus is
If you agree with Scripture, and place your trust in Christ, you will have eternal life.
Until the day I was found, I didn't know I was lost
I was going about business as usual, moving from task to task, distraction to distraction
But then I received an e-mail with the heading: 'I think you're my cousin.'
As I read my cousin's message, I learned that she and another cousin had been searching for my branch of the family for nearly 10 years
The other cousin promised her father, shortly before he died, that she would find his family
I hadn't done anything to get lost, and I didn't have to do anything to be found except acknowledge that I was the person they had been looking for
Learning that they had spent so much time and energy searching for our family made me feel special
This led me to think about the 'lost and found'
parables of Luke 15, the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son
Whenever we wander away from God, whether intentionally like the prodigal son or unintentionally like the sheep, God looks for us
Even though we may not 'feel'
lost, if we have no relationship with God, we are
To be found, we need to realize that God is looking for us and admit that we are separated from Him
By giving up our waywardness, we can be reunited with Him and restored to His family.
In his book Through the Valley of the Kwai, Scottish officer Ernest Gordon wrote of his years as a prisoner of war during World War II
The man suffered from malaria, diphtheria, typhoid, beriberi, dysentery, and jungle ulcers
The hard labor and scarcity of food quickly plunged his weight to less than 100 pounds
The squalor of the prison hospital prompted a desperate Ernest to request to be moved to a cleaner place, the morgue
Lying in the dirt of the death house, he waited to die
But every day, a fellow prisoner came to wash his wounds and to encourage him to eat part of his own rations
As the quiet and unassuming Dusty Miller nursed Ernest back to health, he talked with the agnostic Scotsman of his own strong faith in God and showed him that, even in the midst of suffering, there is hope
The hope we read about in Scripture is not a vague, wishy-washy optimism
Biblical hope is a strong and confident expectation that what God has promised in His Word He will accomplish
Tribulation is often the catalyst that produces perseverance, character, and finally, hope
Seventy years ago, in a brutal POW camp, Ernest Gordon learned this truth himself and said, 'Faith thrives when there is no hope but God'
During the Cold War, a time of tension between the world's superpowers, Albert Einstein said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.'
It was a moment of clarity that focused on the consequences of the choice to fight a nuclear war
Regardless of the motives for making such a choice, the results would be devastating
Unfortunately, we don't always see ahead with such clarity
Sometimes the implications of our choices are hard to anticipate
And sometimes we are thinking only in the moment
According to Hebrews 11:24-26, Moses looked ahead and made a choice based on possible consequences
'By faith Moses, when he became of age,
Moses' choice wasn't easy, but its rightness was made clear because he knew that the troubles he faced for godly living were made bearable by his coming reward
As we look ahead, are we willing to bear 'the reproach of Christ'?, the tough times that come with being associated with Jesus, in exchange for the promised reward of pleasing God?
In the Roman Empire, pagans would often call on the name of a god or goddess as they placed bets in a game of chance
A favorite deity of the gambler was Aphrodite, the Greek word for Venus, the goddess of love
During the roll of the dice, they would say 'epaphroditus!'
literally, 'by Aphrodite!'
In the book of Philippians we read of a Greek convert to the Christian faith by the name of Epaphroditus
He was a close companion of Paul who served him well in his missionary enterprise
Of his friend, Paul wrote: 'Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier'
Epaphroditus was a spiritual brother in Christ, a faithful worker who shared ministry efforts, a brave soldier of the faith, and the carrier of the inspired letter to the church at Philippi
He modeled brotherhood, a work ethic, spiritual endurance, and service
Certainly, Epaphroditus had a well-deserved reputation that showed he did not live by a pagan deity but by faith in Jesus Christ
Even more important than our name are the Christian qualities that are seen in our life: dependability, care, encouragement, and wisdom
What words would you like others to use to describe you?
The most enjoyable part of the stretch-and-flex exercise class I attend is the last 5 minutes
That's when we lie flat on our backs on our mats with the lights down low for relaxation
During one of those times, our instructor said softly, 'Find a place where you can rest into.'
I thought of the best place to 'rest into'
mentioned in the words of a hymn by Cleland B
McAfee, 'Near to the Heart of God.'
This hymn was written in 1901 after the death of McAfee's two nieces from diphtheria
His church choir sang it outside the quarantined home of his brother, offering words of hope about God's heart of care
The apostle Paul tells us that God has a heart of love for us
Nothing, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, height, nor depth, is able to separate us from the enduring love of our Lord
'If God is for us, who can be against us?'
Whatever our stresses or concerns, the heart of God is the place to 'rest into.'
Leave it all with Him, 'for He cares for you'
On a road trip with a friend, we used his GPS navigation device to guide us as we drove each day
After entering our destination on the screen, a voice told us which road to follow, as well as when and where to make each turn
When we left the route, whether accidentally or deliberately, the voice would say, 'Recalculating.'
Then it would tell us how to get back on the right road
Second Timothy 3:16 describes the Bible as a spiritual navigation system for our journey through life
'All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.'
Doctrine tells us which road to travel; reproof tells us when we are off the road; correction tells us how to get back on; instruction in righteousness tells us how to stay on God's road
The mistakes and choices that detour us from the Lord are not to be taken lightly
But failure is seldom fatal and few decisions are final
The moment we veer off on our own, the Holy Spirit is 'recalculating'
and urging us to return to the Father's way
If we've drifted off course, there's no better time than right now to heed God's voice and return to His road.
One day, my toddler exclaimed, 'I love you, Mom!'
I was curious about what makes a 3-year-old tick
So I asked him why he loved me
He answered, 'Because you play cars with me.'
When I asked if there was any other reason, he said, 'Nope That's it.'
My toddler's response made me smile
But it also made me think about the way I relate to God
Do I love and trust Him just because of what He does for me
What about when the blessings disappear
Job had to answer these questions when catastrophes claimed his children and demolished his entire estate
His wife advised him: 'Curse God and die!'
Instead, Job asked, 'Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?'
Yes, Job struggled after his tragedy, he became angry with his friends and questioned the Almighty
Still, he vowed, 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him'
Job's affection for his heavenly Father didn't depend on a tidy solution to his problems
Rather, he loved and trusted God because of all that He is
Job said, 'God is wise in heart and mighty in strength'
Our love for God must not be based solely on His blessings but because of who He is.
The values of the kingdom that Jesus came to establish were radically different than those of His day
The Pharisees and teachers of the law clamored for the spotlight and sought the adulation of the crowds
Many of us still do this today
In Luke 14, Jesus told a parable that taught His followers not to be like that
The parable talks about people who chose the most honored seat for themselves at a wedding feast
He said they would be embarrassed when the host asked them publicly to take their rightful place
Jesus went on in His story to talk about whom to invite to such dinners
He said they shouldn't invite friends and family, but 'when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind
And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you'
Disappointed because you have not broken into the more elite group in your church or neighborhood
Stuck down on rung two when you'd rather be on rung eight or at least climbing the social ladder
Listen to what Jesus said: 'Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted'
That's the radical and upside-down way of God's kingdom!
A mother asked her 5-year-old son to go to the pantry to get her a can of tomato soup
But he refused and protested, 'It's dark in there.'
Mom assured Johnny, 'Don't be afraid
Jesus is in there.'
So Johnny opened the door slowly and seeing that it was dark, shouted, 'Jesus, can you hand me a can of tomato soup?'
This humorous story of Johnny's fear reminds me of Gideon
The Lord appeared to Gideon, calling him a 'mighty man of valor'
and then telling him to deliver Israel out of Midian's hand
But Gideon's fearful reply was, 'My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house'
Even after the Lord told Gideon that with His help he would defeat the Midianites , he was still afraid
Then Gideon asked the Lord for signs to confirm God's will and empowerment
So, why did the Lord address fearful Gideon as a 'mighty man of valor'?
Because of who Gideon would one day become with the Lord's help
We too may doubt our own abilities and potential
But let us never doubt what God can do with us when we trust and obey Him
Gideon's God is the same God who will help us accomplish all that He asks us to do.
Naomi and Ruth came together in less-than-ideal circumstances
To escape a famine in Israel, Naomi's family moved to Moab
While living there, her two sons married Moabite women: Orpah and Ruth
Then Naomi's husband and sons died
In that culture, women were dependent on men, which left the three widows in a predicament
Word came to Naomi that the famine in Israel had ended, so she decided to make the long trek home
Orpah and Ruth started to go with her, but Naomi urged them to return home, saying, 'The hand of the Lord has gone out against me!'
Orpah went home, but Ruth continued, affirming her belief in Naomi's God despite Naomi's own fragile faith
The story started in desperately unpleasant circumstances: famine, death, and despair
It changed direction due to undeserved kindnesses: Ruth to Naomi and Boaz to Ruth
It involved unlikely people: two widows and Boaz, the son of a prostitute
It depended on unexplainable intervention: Ruth just so 'happened'
to glean in the field of Boaz
And it ended in unimaginable blessing: a baby who would be in the lineage of the Messiah
God makes miracles out of what seems insignificant: fragile faith, a little kindness, and ordinary people.
I counted once and discovered that Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains fewer than 300 words
This means, among other things, that words don't have to be many to be memorable
That's one reason I like Psalm 117
Brevity is its hallmark
Think about what God's love means
God loved us before we were born; He will love us after we die
Not one thing can separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus our Lord
His heart is an inexhaustible and irrepressible fountain of love
As I read this brief psalm of praise to God, I can think of no greater encouragement for our journey than its reminder of God's merciful kindness
Praise the Lord!
Amid the celebration, there was tragedy
It was the opening ceremonies of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona
One by one the teams entered the stadium and paraded around the track to the cheers of 65,000 people
But in one section of Olympic Stadium, shock and sadness fell as Peter Karnaugh, father of United States swimmer Ron Karnaugh, was stricken with a fatal heart attack
Five days later, Ron showed up for his race wearing his dad's hat, which he carefully set aside before his competition began
Why the hat
It was the swimmer's tribute to his dad, whom he described as 'my best friend.'
The hat was one his dad had worn when they went fishing and did other things together
Wearing the hat was Ron's way of honoring his dad for standing beside him, encouraging him, and guiding him
When Ron dove into the water, he did so without his dad's presence but inspired by his memory
On this Father's Day, there are many ways to honor our fathers, as Scripture commands us to do
One way, even if they're no longer with us, is to show respect for the good values they taught us
What can you do for your dad today to show him the kind of honor the Bible talks about?
I enjoy playing golf, so I occasionally watch instructional videos
One such video, however, left me disappointed
The teacher presented a golf swing that had at least 8 steps and a dozen sub-points under each step
That was just too much information
While I'm not a great golfer, years of playing have taught me this: The more thoughts you have in your head as you swing, the less likely you are to be successful
You must simplify your thought process and focus on what matters most, making solid contact with the ball
The instructor's many points got in the way
In golf and in life, we must focus on what matters most
In Philippians 3, Paul describes how that relates to the Christian
Rather than being distracted by lesser things, he wanted to focus on what mattered most
He said, 'One thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus'
'One thing I do.'
In a world of distractions, it's vital for the child of God to stay focused, and there is no better point of focus in the universe than Jesus Christ Himself
Is He what matters most to you?
Money is a powerful force
We work for it, save it, spend it, use it to satisfy our earthside longings, and then wish we had more
Aware of its distracting danger, Jesus taught more about money than any other topic
And, as far as we know, He never took an offering for Himself
Clearly, He didn't teach about giving to fill His own pockets
Instead, Jesus warned us that trusting in wealth and using it to gain power clogs our spiritual arteries more readily than most other impediments to spiritual development
In telling the story of the 'rich fool,'
He shamed His listeners for not being rich toward God , indicating that God has a far different definition of wealth than most of us
So, what does it mean to be rich toward God
Paul tells us that those who are rich should not be conceited about their wealth, 'nor to trust in uncertain riches'
Rather, we are to 'be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share'
Interesting
God measures wealth by the quality of our lives and our generous disbursement of wealth to bless others
Not exactly Wall Street insider talk, but great advice for those of us who think that our security and reputation are tied up in the size of our bank account.
In the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake in January 2010, the scenes of destruction and death were often punctuated by someone being pulled alive from the rubble, even after all hope seemed gone
Relief and tears of joy were followed by deep gratitude toward those who worked around the clock, often risking their own lives to give someone else another chance to live
How would you feel if it happened to you
Have you ever been rescued
In Colossians 1, Paul wrote to people who had come to know Jesus Christ and whose lives showed evidence of their faith
After assuring them of his prayers for them to know God's will and to please Him, Paul used a powerful word picture to describe what God had done for them all: 'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins'
In Christ, we have been rescued
He has taken us from danger to safety; from one power and destiny to another; from death to life
It's worth pondering all that being rescued means to us, as we thank God for His grace and power.
Do I really have to read Leviticus?'
A young executive asked me this in earnest as we talked about the value of spending time in reading the Bible
'The Old Testament seems so boring and difficult,' he said
Many Christians feel this way
The answer, of course, is that the Old Testament, including Leviticus, offers background and even contrasts essential to grasping the New Testament
While Isaiah challenges us to seek God , he also promises us that God's Word accomplishes what the Lord wants it to accomplish
Scripture is alive and powerful , and it is useful to teach, correct, and instruct us
God's Word never returns void , but sometimes it is not until later that God's words come to mind as we need them
The Holy Spirit uses the truths we've stored from reading or memorization, and He helps us to apply them at just the right time
For example, Leviticus 19:10-11 speaks of business competition and even caring for the poor
The Spirit can remind us of these concepts, and we can use them, if we've spent time reading and contemplating that passage
Reading the Bible turns our minds into storehouses through which the Spirit can work
That's a great reason to read Leviticus and the other 65 books as well.
Every parent knows the difference between rules designed primarily for the benefit of the parent and those designed for the benefit of the child
God's rules fall into the latter category
As Creator of the human race, God knows how human society will work best
I began to look at the Ten Commandments in this light, as rules designed primarily for our benefit
Jesus underscored this principle when He said, 'The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath'
The Bible is a most realistic book
It assumes human beings will be tempted to lust after a neighbor or covet someone else's property, to work too hard, to strike out in anger at those who wrong them
It assumes humanity will bring disorder to whatever we touch
Each of the Ten Commandments offers a shield of protection against that disorder
We have the freedom to say no to our sinful inclinations
By doing so, we avoid certain harm
Taken together, the Ten Commandments weave life on this planet into a more meaningful and structured whole
The benefit of which is to allow us to live as a peaceful, healthy community under God.
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline stretches 800 miles through Alaska
Because it was built through an earthquake zone, engineers had to be sure the pipe could withstand earth trauma
Engineers were delighted when the first big test came
In 2002, an earthquake occurred causing the ground to move 18 feet to one side
The Teflon sliders moved gently to accommodate the movement without any damage to the pipe
The key was flexibility
The believer's spiritual pipeline to heaven is built upon firm trust in God
But if we are inflexible in our expectations of how God should work, we can run into trouble
In a crisis, we can make the mistake of shifting our focus from God to our painful circumstances
Our prayer should be, 'God, I don't understand why You have allowed this painful situation
But I am trusting in Your ultimate deliverance despite all that's going on around me.'
The psalmist expressed this so well when he wrote: 'My soul trusts in You
until these calamities have passed by'
When the earth seems to move under us, let's be flexible in our expectations but firmly confident in God's steadfast love and care.
We like to read about comebacks, about people or companies who face near disaster and turn things around
The Ford Motor Company is an example of that
In the 1940s, a reluctance by leadership to modernize almost destroyed Ford
In fact, the government nearly took over the company lest its demise threaten the US war effort
But when Henry Ford II was released from his military duties to run the company, things turned around
Ford became one of the biggest corporations in the world
Occasionally, we need a comeback
We need to correct wrong directions or compensate for wrong decisions
In those times, we have an example in Peter
He had failure written all over him
First, he nearly drowned when his faith faltered
Then he said things that were so wrong Jesus called him 'Satan'
And when Jesus needed Peter the most, he denied that he even knew Him
But that's not the end of the story
In the power of the Spirit, Peter made a comeback
On the Day of Pentecost, he preached and 3,000 people came to faith in Christ
Peter returned to effectiveness because his faith was renewed, he guarded what he said, and he stood up for Jesus
If Peter can come back, so can you
Weddings have long been an occasion for extravagance
Modern weddings have become a chance for young women to live out the fantasy of being 'a princess for a day.'
An elegant gown, an elaborate hairstyle, attendants in color-coordinated dresses, bouquets of flowers, an abundance of food, and lots of celebrating with friends and family contribute to the fairytale atmosphere
Many parents start saving early so they can afford the high cost of making their daughter's dream come true
And royal weddings take extravagance to a level that we 'commoners'
seldom see
In 1981, however, many of us got a peek at one when the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was broadcast worldwide
Another royal wedding is in the planning stages, and it will be more elaborate than any other
But in this wedding, the most important person will be the groom, Christ Himself; and we, the church, will be His bride
John's revelation says that the bride will make herself ready and that our wedding gown will be our righteous acts
Though earthly marriages last only a lifetime, every bride works hard to make her wedding perfect
How much more, as the bride of Christ, should we be doing to prepare ourselves for a marriage that will last for eternity.
In some cultures, the title below your name on your business card is very important
It identifies your rank
The way you are treated depends on your title as compared with others around you
If Paul had a business card, it would have identified him as an 'apostle'
meaning 'sent one.'
He used this title not out of pride but out of wonder
He didn't earn that position; it was 'by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ.'
In other words, his was not a human but a divine appointment
Paul had formerly been a 'blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man'
He said that he considered himself to be the 'chief' of sinners
But because of God's mercy, he was now an apostle, one to whom 'the King eternal'
had committed the glorious gospel and whom He had sent out to share that gospel
What is more amazing is that like the apostle Paul we are all sent out by the King of kings to the world
Let's recognize with humility that we don't deserve such a commission either
It is our privilege to represent Him and His eternal truth in word and in deed each day to all around us.
When my wife and I were traveling in another state, someone broke into our car after we stopped for lunch
With one look at the shattered glass, we realized that we had forgotten to put our GPS out of sight
With a quick check of the backseat, I concluded that the thief also got my laptop, passport, and checkbook
Then came the surprise
Later that evening, after phone calls and hours of growing worries, the unexpected happened
When I opened my suitcase, tucked between my clothes was what I thought I had lost
I couldn't believe my eyes
Only then did I recall that I had not put the items in the backseat after all
I had stuck them in the suitcase, which had been safely stored in the trunk of our car
Sometimes, in the emotion of the moment, our minds play tricks on us
We think our loss is worse than it is
We may feel like the songwriter David who, in the confusion of the moment, thought God had forgotten him
When David later recalled what he knew rather than what he feared, his sense of loss turned into a song of praise
His renewed joy foreshadowed what is now ours to recall: Nothing can rob us of what is most important if our life is 'hidden with Christ in God'
My wife, Martie, is a great cook
Sitting down after a busy day to enjoy her culinary delights is a real treat
Sometimes after dinner she runs errands, leaving me alone with the choice of grabbing the remote or cleaning up the kitchen
When I'm on my good behavior, I roll up my sleeves, load the dishwasher, and scrub the pots and pans, all for the joy of hearing Martie's grateful response, which is usually something like, 'Wow, Joe
You didn't have to clean up the kitchen!'
Which gives me a chance to say, 'I wanted to show you how much I love you!'
When Jesus reproved the church at Ephesus for abandoning their 'first love'
it was because they were doing a lot of good things, but not out of love for Him
Although they were praised for their perseverance and patience, from Christ's point of view, they were being good for nothing
Good behavior should always be an act of worship
Resisting temptation, forgiving, serving, and loving each other are all opportunities to tangibly express our love for Jesus, not to get a star next to our name or a pat on the back
When was the last time you did something 'good'
out of love for Jesus?
When Polycarp , who was bishop of the church at Smyrna, was asked by Roman authorities to curse Christ if he wanted to be released, he said, 'Eighty-six years I have served Him, and He never did me any wrong
How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?'
The Roman officer threatened, 'If you do not change your mind, I will have you consumed with fire.'
Polycarp remained undaunted
Because he would not curse Christ, he was burned at the stake
Centuries earlier, when three young men named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego faced a similar threat, they answered, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king
But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods'
A similar experience but two different outcomes
Polycarp was burned alive, but Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego left the furnace unsinged
Two different results but the same display of faith
These men showed us that faith in God is not simply faith in what God can do
But it's the belief that God is God whether He delivers us or not
He has the final say
And it's our decision to choose to follow Him through it all.
Following a recent lunch discussion, I decided to research the comment that a bull shark attack had once occurred in Lake Michigan
It seemed like such an impossible thought that we all scoffed at the idea of sharks in a freshwater lake so far inland
I found one online site that claimed a bull shark attack did occur in Lake Michigan in 1955, but it was never verified
A shark attack in Lake Michigan
If the story were true, it would definitely be a rare occurrence
Wouldn't it be great if hard times were like Lake Michigan bull shark attacks, rare or even untrue
But they aren't
Hardships and difficulties are common
It's just that when they happen to us, we think they shouldn't
Perhaps that is why the apostle Peter, writing to first-century followers of Christ going through tough times, said, 'Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you'
These trials are not abnormal, and once we get past our surprise, we can turn to the Father who ministers deeply to our hearts and in our lives
He has a love that never fails
And in our world filled with trials, that kind of love is desperately needed.
During an international publishing conference, a young Frenchman described his experience at a book- signing event
A woman picked up one of his books, browsed through it, and exclaimed, 'At last, a story that's clean!'
He replied gently, 'I write clean because I think clean
It's not an effort.'
What he expressed in print came from within, where Christ had altered the very core of his life
John 15 records Jesus' lesson to His disciples about abiding in Him as the only means to a fruitful life
In the midst of His imagery of the vine and the branches, Jesus said: 'You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you'
Bible scholar WE Vine says that the Greek word for clean means 'free from impure admixture, without blemish, spotless.'
A pure heart is the work of Christ, and only in His power can we remain clean
We often fail, but 'if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
cleanse us from all unright-eousness'
Renewal is an inside job
Jesus has made us clean through His sacrifice and His Word
Our speech and actions that strike others as being fresh and pure flow from inside out as we abide in Christ.
Over the past several years, I've been privileged to travel with teenagers on eight mission trips
One thing I've learned in those excursions is that teens are not too young to make an impact for Jesus, either on me or on others whose lives they touch
I've also noticed that the teens who make the biggest impact for Christ match the characteristics Paul told Timothy about in 1 Timothy 4:12
Trying to convince Timothy that his relative youth did not have to be a deterrent to his ministry, Paul told him to 'be an example to the believers'
in several areas
In word: Young people who make a difference for Christ control what they say, avoid negative talk, and speak words that honor God
In conduct: Teens who practice discretion in their behavior shine for all the world to see
In love: By taking heed of Jesus' words to love God and their neighbor teens please Jesus and touch hearts
In faith: Those who put their faith into action change lives
In purity: It's tough to be morally pure and doctrinally sound, but kids who are can set the bar for the rest of us
Paul's words aren't just for the young generation
All of us should be an example in word, conduct, love, faith, and purity
That's how we make an impact for Christ.
The book of Jonah has the makings of a great movie plot
It contains a runaway prophet, a terrible storm at sea, the prophet swallowed by a great fish, God sparing the prophet's life, and the repentance of a pagan city
But Jonah's sequel, the book of Nahum, might not be so popular
Nahum ministered in Nineveh just as Jonah had, but about 100 years later
This time, the Ninevites had no interest in repentance
Because of this, Nahum condemns Nineveh and proclaims judgment on the people
To unrepentant Nineveh, the prophet preached: 'The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked'
But Nahum also had a message of mercy
To comfort the people of Judah, he proclaimed: 'The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him'
We see in the stories of Jonah and Nahum that with every new generation comes the necessity of an individual response to God
No one's spiritual life can be handed off to another; we must each choose to serve the Lord from our own heart
God's message is as fresh today as it was hundreds of years ago: judgment for the unrepentant but mercy for the repentant
How will you respond?
My state's name, 'Idaho,'
according to one legend, comes from a Shoshone Indian word, 'ee-dah-how.'
When translated into English, it means something like, 'Behold
The sun rising over the mountain.'
I often think of that when the sun breaks over the eastern peaks and spills light and life into our valley
Also, I think of Malachi's promise: 
The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings
This is God's irrevocable promise that our Lord Jesus will come again and all creation 'will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God'
Each new sunrise is a reminder of that eternal morning when 'bright heaven's Sun'
will arise with healing in His wings
Then everything that has been made will be made over and made irrevocably right
There will be no throbbing backs or knees, no financial struggles, no losses, no aging
One Bible version says that when Jesus returns we will 'go out and leap like calves released from the stall'
This is my highest imagination and my hope
Jesus said, 'Surely I am coming quickly'
Even so, come, Lord Jesus!
Chuck had slowed to a stop when his car was hit from behind and was pushed into the vehicle ahead of him
A sickening, crunching sound indicated that additional vehicles had collided behind them
As Chuck sat quietly for a moment, he observed that the vehicle directly behind him was pulling out into traffic
Obviously hoping to avoid an encounter with police, the escaping driver neglected to notice he had left something behind
When the police arrived, an officer picked up the hit-and-run driver's license plate from the ground and said to Chuck, 'Someone will be waiting for him when he arrives home
He won't get away with this.'
Scripture tells us
'be sure your sin will find you out'
, as this man who fled the accident discovered
We may sometimes be able to hide our sin from the people around us, but nothing is ever 'hidden from [God's] sight'
He sees each of our failures, thoughts, and motivations
Believers are given a wonderful promise: 'If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
So don't let unconfessed, so-called 'hidden'
An elderly TV star was asked by talk-show host Larry King about heaven
King prefaced his question by referring to Billy Graham, who had told King he 'knew what would be ahead
It would be paradise
He was going to heaven.'
King then asked his guest, 'What do you believe?'
He replied, 'I'd like a lot of activity
Heaven sounds too placid for me
There's a lot to do in hell.'
Sadly, this man is not alone in thinking that an existence in Satan's realm is a preferred destination
I've heard people say that they'd rather be in hell because all their friends will be there
One person wrote, 'If hell was real, I don't think it would be bad
There would be a lot of interesting people
How can we convince folks who are deceived in this way that hell and its horrors are to be avoided
Perhaps by telling them of the realities of hell that are presented in the Scripture
In Daniel 12:2, it is described as a place of 'shame and everlasting contempt
Luke 16:23 talks about torments
Matthew 8:12 describes weeping and gnashing of teeth
And Revelation 14:11 says there will be no rest
Biblical truth doesn't allow anyone to think that hell might be a good place to be
Clearly, rejecting Jesus and facing an eternity in Satan's kingdom is a bad choice.
I've always been impressed by the solemn, magnificent simplicity of the Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery
The carefully choreographed event is a moving tribute to soldiers whose names, and sacrifice, are 'known but to God.'
Equally moving are the private moments of steady pacing when the crowds are gone: back and forth, hour after hour, day by day, in even the worst weather
In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel was bearing down on Washington, DC, and the guards were told they could seek shelter during the worst of the storm
Surprising almost no one, the guards refused
They unselfishly stood their post to honor their fallen comrades even in the face of a hurricane
Underlying Jesus' teaching in Matthew 6:1-6, I believe, is His desire for us to live with an unrelenting, selfless devotion to Him
The Bible calls us to good deeds and holy living, but these are to be acts of worship and obedience , not orchestrated acts for self-glorification
The apostle Paul endorses this whole-life faithfulness when he pleads with us to make our bodies 'a living sacrifice'
May our private and public moments speak of our devotion and wholehearted commitment to You, Lord.
On a recent trip, my wife was seated near a mother with a young boy on his first flight
As the plane took off, he exclaimed, 'Mom, look how high we are
And everything's getting smaller!'
A few minutes later he shouted, 'Are those clouds down there
What are they doing under us'
As time passed, other passengers read, dozed, and lowered their window shades to watch the in-flight video
This boy, however, remained glued to the window, absorbed in the wonder of all he was seeing
For experienced travelers in the Christian life, there can be great danger in losing the wonder
The Scriptures that once thrilled us may become more familiar and academic
We may fall into the lethargy of praying with our minds but not our hearts
Peter urged the early followers of Christ to continue growing in their faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love
He said, 'If these things are yours and abound [or are increasing], you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Without them we become blind and forget the marvel of being cleansed from our sins
May God grant us all grace to keep growing in the wonder of knowing Him.
He was frustrated
He was angry
He was tired of being blamed for everything that went wrong
Year after year, he had gotten them through one disaster after another
He was continually interceding on their behalf to keep them out of trouble
But all he got for his efforts was more grief
Finally, in exasperation, he said, 'Hear now, you rebels
Must we bring water for you out of this rock?'
That suggestion might sound preposterous, but it wasn't
Forty years earlier, the previous generation had the same complaint: no water
God told Moses to strike a rock with his staff
When he obeyed, water gushed out, plenty of water
When the grumbling started again so many years later, Moses did the thing that worked before
But this time it was the wrong thing to do
What Moses told the Israelites to do, to listen, he himself had not done
God had told him to speak to the rock this time, not strike it
Sometimes in exhaustion or exasperation, we don't pay close attention to God
We assume He will always work the same way
But He doesn't
Sometimes He tells us to act; sometimes He tells us to speak; sometimes He tells us to wait
That is why we must always be careful to listen before we take action.
During the era of great sea exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries, sailing ships traversed vast, hazardous oceans and navigated dangerous coastlines
Pilots used various navigation techniques, including a book called a 'rutter'
This was a log of events kept by earlier voyagers who chronicled their encounters with previously unknown and difficult waters
By reading the sailing details in a rutter, captains could avoid hazards and make it through difficult waters
In many ways, the Christian life is like a voyage, and the believer needs help in navigating life's perilous seas
We have that help because God has given us His Word as a 'spiritual rutter.'
Often when we reflect on a meaningful passage, we can recall God's faithfulness through trying circumstances
As the psalmist suggests, perils are found not only in life situations but also in our inner tendency toward sin
Because of these dual concerns, he wrote, 'Direct my steps by Your Word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me'
As you reflect on the teaching in the Bible, you'll be reminded of God's past care, assured of the Lord's guidance in trying circumstances, and warned against sinfulness
That's the advantage of having a 'spiritual rutter.'?
In early 1994, when our family found out that the US soccer team would be playing in Michigan in the World Cup, we knew we had to go
What a great time we had as we went to the Pontiac Silverdome to see the US take on Switzerland
It was one of the most remarkable events of our lives
There was just one problem
One of our four children, 9-year-old Melissa, couldn't join us
While we enjoyed the event, it was not the same without her
Even in our joy at being there, we felt sadness because of her absence
As I think back on that day, I'm reminded that our sadness then is a little like our sadness now that Melissa is gone from this life, having died in a car accident 8 years after that game
While we cherish the help of the 'God of all comfort'
even that great comfort doesn't change the reality of her empty chair at family gatherings
Scripture doesn't tell us that God wipes away our sadness in this life, but it does tell us that God is faithful and will comfort us
If you have lost a loved one, lean heavily on God's comfort
Keep trusting Him
But know that it's okay to feel sadness for this absence
Consider it one more reason to place your burdens on your loving heavenly Father.
I've been amazed at the impact that my wife, Martie, has had on the lives of our kids
Very few roles demand the kind of unconditional, self-sacrificing perseverance and commitment as that of motherhood
I know for certain that my character and faith have been shaped and molded by my mom, Corabelle
Let's face it, where would we be without our wives and mothers
It reminds me of one of my favorite memories in sports history
Phil Mickelson walked up the 18th fairway at the Masters Golf Tournament in 2010 after his final putt to clinch one of golf's most coveted prizes for the third time
But it wasn't his victory leap on the green that had an impact on me
It was when he made a beeline through the crowd to his wife, who was battling life-threatening cancer
They embraced, and the camera caught a tear running down Phil's cheek as he held his wife close for a long time
Our wives need to experience the kind of sacrificial, selfless love that has been shown to us by the Lover of our souls
As Paul put it, 'Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her'
Prizes come and go, but it's the people you love, and who love you, that matter most.
In a radio interview, a basketball superstar was asked about his knack for making the game-winning shot in crucial situations
The reporter asked how he was able to be so calm in such pressure-packed moments
His answer was that he tried to simplify the situation
You only have to make one shot, the player replied
One shot
That is the essence of simplifying a difficult situation
Focus only on what is in front of you right now
Don't worry about the expectations of your coach or teammates
Simplify
Recognizing that the challenges of life can be both overwhelming and suffocating, Jesus urged us to take matters in hand by simplifying
He said, 'Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things
Sufficient for the day is its own trouble'
This was His wise conclusion to His teaching on the debilitating power of worry
Worry doesn't accomplish anything positive; it just adds to the sense that we are drowning in the troubles we are facing
We must take things as they come­, one day at a time­, and trust Him for the wisdom to respond properly
If you feel overwhelmed by life, do what you can today and then entrust the rest to Him
As Jesus said, 'Each day has enough trouble of its own'
While enjoying the arrival of a new great-niece, I was reminded of how much work it is to take care of a newborn baby
They are needy little creations who want feeding, changing, holding, feeding, changing, holding, feeding, changing, holding
Totally unable to care for themselves, they depend on those older and wiser people surrounding them
We're dependent children too, reliant on our Father in heaven
What do we need from Him that we can't provide for ourselves
In Him we live and move and have our being'
He supplies our very breath
He also meets our needs 'according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus
We need our Father for peace in our troubles , love , and help in time of need
He gives victory in temptation , forgiveness , purpose , and eternal life
Without Him, we 'can do nothing'
And from Him, 'we have all received one blessing after another'
Let's not think of ourselves as totally independent, because we're not
The Lord sustains us day by day
In many ways, we're as needy as a newborn baby.
A friend of mine pastors a church in a small mountain community not far from Boise, Idaho
The community is nestled in a wooded valley through which a pleasant little stream meanders
Behind the church and alongside the stream is a grove of willows, a length of grass, and a sandy beach
It's an idyllic spot that has long been a place where members of the community gather to picnic
One day, a man in the congregation expressed concern over the legal implications of 'outsiders' using the property
If someone is injured, he said, the church might be sued
Though the elders were reluctant to take any action, the man convinced them that they should post a sign on the site informing visitors that this was private property
Anyone using this beach may, at any moment, be surrounded by people who love you
I read his sign the week after he put it up and was charmed
Exactly, I thought
Once again grace has triumphed over law
This love for one's neighbor springs from God's kindness, forbearance, and patience with us
It's not the law, but the goodness of God that draws men and women to repentance and to saving faith in His Son Jesus Christ.
I love the old photographs that are often printed on the obituary page of our local newspaper
A grinning young man in a military uniform and words such as: 92 years old, fought for his country in WW II
Or the young woman with sparkling eyes: 89 years young, grew up on a farm in Kansas during the Depression
Too often, those who have had a long life feel sidelined when they reach their later years
Psalm 92, however, reminds us that no matter how old we are, we can have a fresh and fruitful life
Men and women who have been planted in the rich soil of God's vineyard will continue to bear fruit and be fresh and flourishing
Jesus promised that he who abides in Me, and I in him, will continue to bear much fruit
Yes, muscles may ache and joints may hurt, and life may slow down a bit
But inwardly we can be renewed day by day
I recently saw a T-shirt on a beautiful white-haired woman that said: 'I'm not 80
I'm 18 with 62 years experience.
No matter how old we get, we can still be young at heart, but with the benefit of a well-lived lifetime of knowledge and wisdom.
While reading the first chapter of James, I was struck by the phrase 'humbly accept the Word planted in you, which can save you'
A decision with which I'd been struggling came to mind, and I thought: I don't need to read another book, attend another seminar, or ask another friend about this
I need to obey what the Bible tells me to do
My efforts to be better informed had become a means of resisting God's instruction rather than receiving it
James was writing to followers of Christ when he said: 'Lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls
But be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves'
Bible scholar WE Vine said that the Greek word used here for receive means 'deliberate and ready reception of what is offered.'
Meekness is an attitude toward God 'in which we accept His dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting.'
A humble heart doesn't fight against God or contend with Him
God's powerful Word, implanted in our hearts, is a trustworthy source of spiritual wisdom and strength
It's available to all who will humbly receive it.
I watched from my balcony as a 20-story apartment building was demolished
The demolition took barely a week to complete
In its place a new building is being constructed
It's been months now, and despite construction activities going on nights and weekends, it is still incomplete
How much easier it is to tear down than to build up
What is true for demolition and construction of buildings is also true for personal relationships
In Philippians 4:2, Paul wrote to two women in the church, saying, 'I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.'
The quarrel between these two women threatened to tear down the witness of the Philippian church if left unresolved
So Paul urged a true companion to help rebuild that relationship
Sadly, Christians do quarrel, but we should seek to live peaceably with all
Unless our conflicts are resolved, the Christian witness so painstakingly built up can be destroyed
It takes much effort and time to reconcile broken relationships
But it is worth it
Like a new building rising from the ruins, reconciled believers can emerge stronger
May we seek to build each other up through our words and actions today!
Being afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, Thomas DeBaggio chronicled his gradual memory loss in the book Losing My Mind
This book records the disturbing process by which, little by little, tasks, places, and people are all forgotten
Alzheimer's disease involves the failure of nerve cells in the brain, leading to gradual memory loss, confusion, and disorientation
It can be tragic to watch a previously mentally alert person slowly forget how to dress or fail to recognize the faces of loved ones
It's like losing the person before he dies
Memory loss can occur by other means as well, such as injury or life trauma
And for those of us who live into old age, the breakdown of our bodies is inevitable
But for the Christian, there is hope
When believers receive their glorified bodies at the resurrection, they will be perfect
But even more important, in heaven we will recognize the One who died to redeem us
We will remember what He did and know Him by the nail prints in His hands
Forgetfulness may beset our earthly bodies, but when we see the Lord, 'We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is'
One Sunday while preaching, a pastor was accosted and punched by a man
He continued preaching, and the man was arrested
The pastor prayed for him and even visited him in jail a few days later
What an example of the way to respond to insult and injury
While there is a place for self-defense, personal revenge was forbidden in the Old Testament: 'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself'
It was also forbidden by Jesus and the apostles
The Old Testament law exacted like for like , which ensured that judicial punishment was not unjust or malicious
But there was a larger principle looming when it came to personal revenge: Justice must be done, but it must be left in the hands of God or the authorities ordained by God
Instead of returning injury and insult, may we live by Christ-honoring and Spirit-empowered alternatives: Live at peace with everyone , submit to a spiritual mediator , and leave it in the hands of authorities and, most of all, in God's hands.
Have you ever felt that life is unfair
For those of us who are committed to following the will and ways of Jesus, it's easy to get frustrated when people who don't care about Him seem to do well in life
A businessman cheats yet wins a large contract, and the guy who parties all the time is robust and healthy while you or your loved ones struggle with finances or medical issues
It makes us feel cheated, like maybe we've been good for nothing
If you've ever felt that way, you're in good company
The writer of Psalm 73 goes through a whole list of how the wicked prosper, and then he says, 'Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain'
But the tide of his thoughts turns when he recalls his time in God's presence: Then I understood their end
When we spend time with God and see things from His point of view, it changes our perspective completely
We may be jealous of the nonbelievers now, but we won't be at judgment time
As the saying goes, what difference does it make if you win the battle but lose the war
Like the psalmist, let's praise God for His presence in this life and His promise of the life to come
He is all you need, even when life seems unfair.
The book titled UnChristian lists reasons why some non-Christians don't like people who profess faith in Jesus Christ
Their major complaints have to do with the way some Christians act toward unbelievers
The unbelievers in the study tended to view Christians as being hypocritical, judgmental, harsh, and unloving toward people not like themselves
I'm sure you dislike hearing their view of Christians as I do
Sometimes there's more truth in their perceptions than we wish there was
In 1 John 3, which begins with the words, 'Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!'
John introduces a sharp contrast: Believers love righteousness, keep themselves from sin, and love one another; nonbelievers practice sin, hate others, and abide in death
These are strong words
We are either followers of Jesus Christ or of the devil
We are like Cain or Abel
John says that love for others is what proves we are genuine children of God
We can't continue to practice sin and claim to be followers of Christ
Let's always make sure our words and deeds back up our beliefs.
Children want things now: 'But I want dessert now!'
'Are we there yet?'
'Now can we open our presents?'
In contrast, as we get older we learn to wait
Medical students wait through training
Parents wait in hopes that the prodigal will return
We wait for what is worth waiting for, and in the process we learn patience
God, who is timeless, requires of us a mature faith that may involve delays that seem like trials
Patience is one sign of that maturity, a quality that can develop only through the passing of time
Many prayers in the Bible come out of the act of waiting
Jacob waited 7 years for a wife and then worked 7 more after being tricked by her father
The Israelites waited 4 centuries for deliverance; Moses waited 4 decades for the call to lead them, then 4 more decades for a Promised Land he would not enter
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning wrote the psalmist
The picture comes to mind of a watchman counting the minutes for his shift to be over
I pray for the patience to endure times of trial, to keep anticipating, keep hoping, keep believing
I pray for patience to be patient.
Recently, I heard of a sport that challenges my imagination, I can't comprehend why anyone would play it
It's called 'Toe Wrestling.'
Every year, people from across the globe gather in England for the world championships
Competitors sit on the ground facing each other and then lock the big toe of the other's bare foot
The object is to pin the opponent's foot in a manner similar to the way an arm wrestler pins a competitor's wrist
It sounds strange to me
In a way, this unusual competition gives honor to a part of the body that's largely ignored, until we drop something on it
Our toes and feet are vital parts of our anatomy, yet we pay little attention to them unless they hurt
Perhaps that's why Paul used the foot to remind us that there are no unimportant parts in the body of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 12:15, he said, 'If the foot should say, '\sBecause I am not a hand, I am not of the body,' is it therefore not of the body?'
The only correct answer: Of course it's part of the body.
Paul wants us to realize that each person in the body of Christ is important
Even if you think of yourself as the most overlooked and ignored member of the body of Christ, you have value
And you can honor God like a true champion by using your unique skills for God's glory.
As 19-year-old Amelia waited in her doctor's office, she recognized the familiar hymn Softly and Tenderly Jesus Is Calling playing over the speaker
It made her smile when she remembered the words
Perhaps a song with the lyrics 'shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming' was not the most appropriate background music for a doctor's office
Some find this old hymn too sentimental for their taste
But the message of the chorus can be encouraging for the wayward sinner: Come home, come home,  Ye who are weary, come home;  Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,  Calling, 'O sinner, come home!'
When a believer replaces God's will with his own, he will find himself in a backslidden condition, out of fellowship with God, in an unenviable state
Although we sometimes yield to our self-centered nature, God is always ready to welcome us back
Because of His loving kindness and tender mercies, it gives Him joy when we forsake our rebellious ways, return to Him, and ask for forgiveness
Has your heart and mind slipped away from your Savior
Jesus is calling and waiting for you to come back home.
In 1860, Thomas Inman recommended that his fellow doctors not prescribe a medicine for a cure if they weren't sure it would work
They were to give the patient 'the benefit of our doubts.'
This phrase is also a legal term meaning that if a jury has conflicting evidence that makes the jurors doubtful, they are to give the verdict of 'not guilty.'
Perhaps as Christians, we can learn from and apply this medical and legal phrase to our relationships
Better yet, we can learn from the Bible about giving the benefit of the doubt to others
First Corinthians 13:7 says that love 'bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.'
Leon Morris, in the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, says this about the phrase 'believes all things'?: 'To see the best in others
This does not mean that love is gullible, but that it does not think the worst
It retains its faith
Love is not deceived
but it is always ready to give the benefit of the doubt.'
When we hear something negative about others or we're suspicious about the motive for their actions, let's stop before we judge their intentions as wrong or bad
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
Can you tell me where I can find the lightbulbs'
Sure Come with me, and I'll take you to them.'
In many large stores, employees are instructed to take customers to find what they are looking for rather than simply giving them verbal directions
This common act of courtesy and walking alongside an inquiring person may help us expand our concept of what it means to lead others to Christ
In John 1, the phrase come and see occurs twice
When two curious disciples of John the Baptist asked Jesus where He was staying, the Lord said, Come and see
After spending the day with Him, Andrew found his brother, Simon Peter, and brought him to Jesus
Later, Philip told Nathanael he had found the Messiah
To Nathanael's skeptical reply, Philip said, Come and see
Witnessing for Christ can be a one-time event when we speak the good news about Him to others
But it may also involve walking alongside people who are seeking help and wholeness
Our genuine interest in their spiritual welfare, our prayers, and our involvement with them say without words, Come and see
Let's walk together, and I'll take you to Him.
At the end of my mother's earthly journey, she and Dad were still very much in love and shared a strong faith in Christ
My mother had developed dementia and began to lose memories of even her family
Yet Dad would regularly visit her at the assisted living home and find ways to accommodate her diminished capacities
For instance, he would take her some saltwater taffy, unwrap a piece, and place it in her mouth, something she could not do for herself
Then as she slowly chewed the candy, Dad would quietly sit with her and hold her hand
When their time together was over, Dad, beaming with a wide smile, would say, I feel such peace and joy spending time with her.
Though touched by Dad's great joy in helping Mom, I was more affected by the reality that he was depicting God's grace
Jesus was willing to humble Himself to connect with us in our weaknesses
In reflecting on Christ's incarnation, John wrote, 'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us'
Taking on human limitations, He did countless acts of compassion to accommodate us in our weakness
Do you know anyone who might benefit from Jesus' helpful, accommodating love that could flow through you to them today?
When I stuck my camera into the bush to take a picture of the baby robins, they opened their mouths without opening their eyes
They were so used to having mama robin feed them whenever the branches moved that they didn't even look to see who was causing the disturbance
That is the kind of trust that loving mothers instill in their children
That is the kind of mom I am blessed to have
Growing up, I could eat whatever food she put on the table without fear that it would harm me
Although she made me eat things I didn't like, I knew she did so because they were good for me
If she cared only about what was easy for her, she would have let me eat junk food
No matter what Mom told me to do, or not to do, I knew she had my best interest in mind
She wasn't trying to keep me from having fun; she was trying to protect me from being hurt
That is the kind of relationship we have with God, who compared Himself to a mother: As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you
As His children, we have no reason to fear what happens to us nor to envy what happens to others: Do not be envious of the workers of iniquity
When we trust His goodness, we are fed by His faithfulness.
When the US Civil War ended in 1865, more than half a million soldiers lay dead, the economy was shattered, and people remained deeply divided politically
The observance of Mother's Day in the United States began with two women's efforts for peace and reconciliation during this time of anguish
In 1870, Julia Ward Howe called for an International Mother's Day on which women would unite in opposing war in all its forms
A few years later, Anna Reeves Jarvis began her annual Mother's Friendship Day in an effort to reunite families and neighbors alienated by the war
There is always great suffering when friends and families are fractured and unwilling to forgive
The gospel of Jesus Christ brings the promise of peace and reconciliation with God and with each other
When Peter asked Jesus how often he should forgive a brother who sinned against him , the Lord surprised everyone with His answer of 'seventy times seven'
Then He told an unforgettable story about a servant who had received forgiveness and failed to pass it on
As God freely forgives us, so He requires that we extend what we have received to others
With God's love and power, forgiveness is always possible.
Every year I do something special to celebrate the arrival of spring , I buy ant traps
Those little invaders continually march into our kitchen in search of any crumb left on the floor
They aren't picky; a shard of potato chip, a grain of rice, or even a speck of cheese will do
Although ants may be a nuisance, Solomon praised them for their steadfast work ethic
He pointed out that ants are self-directed
They have no captain, overseer or ruler, yet they are very productive
The ants also keep busy even when it's not immediately necessary, providing supplies in the summer and gathering food in the harvest
By the time winter arrives, they're not worried about what they will eat
Little by little, these hard workers have saved up enough to sustain themselves
We can learn from the ant
When God gives us times of plenty, we can prepare for times when resources may be low
God is the provider of all that we have, including our ability to work
We are to work diligently, be wise stewards of what He has provided, and then rest in the promise of His care
Let's remember Solomon's advice: 'Go to the ant, consider her ways and be wise'
One morning, when I was a young child, I was sitting in the kitchen, watching my mother prepare breakfast
Unexpectedly, the grease in the skillet in which she was frying bacon caught fire
Flames shot into the air and my mother ran to the pantry for some baking soda to throw on the blaze
Help I shouted
And then I added, 'Oh, I wish it was time to pray'
It's time to pray must have been a frequent household expression, and I took it quite literally to mean we could pray only at certain times
The time to pray, of course, is any time, especially when we're in crisis
Fear, worry, anxiety, and care are the most common occasions for prayer
It is when we are desolate, forsaken, and stripped of every human resource that we naturally resort to prayer
We cry out with the words of David, 'Help me, O Lord!'
John Cassian, a 5th-century Christian, wrote of this verse: 'This is the terrified cry of someone who sees the snares of the enemy, the cry of someone besieged day and night and exclaiming that he cannot escape unless his Protector comes to the rescue.'
May this be our simple prayer in every crisis and all day long: 'Help, Lord!'?
In the annals of US advertising history, one of the most efficient slogans ever is the California milk producers' two-word question, 'Got milk?'
With that phrase, the group captured almost everyone's attention
In surveys, the slogan was recognized by more than 90 percent of the people polled
perhaps we can create some two-word slogans to remind ourselves to live more godly lives
Let's turn to James 4 and try it
This passage gives four specific guidelines
1 Give in 
Verse 7 tells us to submit to God
Our sovereign God loves us, so why not let Him run the show
Submission helps us resist the devil
2 Get close
Verse 8 reminds us of the value of drawing near to God
It's up to us to close the gap between us and God
3 Clean up
Verse 8 also reminds us to make sure our hearts are clean
That happens through confessing our sins to God
4 Get down
James says we need to be humble before God
That includes viewing our sin as something to weep over
Give in
Get close
Clean up
Get down
These pairs of words may not look as good on a T-shirt as 'Got milk?'
But they sure will look good on us.
Having played intercollegiate soccer, I've never lost my love for 'The Beautiful Game.'
I especially enjoy watching the English Premier League
One reason is the skill and speed with which the game is played there
Also, I love the way the fans sing in support of their beloved 'sides.'
For instance, Liverpool has for years had You'll Never Walk Alone as its theme
How moving to hear 50,000 fans rise as one to sing the lyrics of that old standard
It's an encouragement to players and fans alike that together they will see each other through to the end
This sentiment has meaning for everyone
Because each of us is made for community, isolation and loneliness are among the most painful of human experiences
During painful times, our faith is vital
The child of God never needs to fear abandonment
Even if people turn on us, friends forsake us, or circumstances separate us from loved ones, we are never alone
God has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
This is not just a nice tune or clever lyrics offering an empty sentiment
It is the promise of God Himself to those who are the objects of His love
He is there, and He isn't going away
With Christ, you will never walk alone.
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by rules and expectations
Think of how the Jewish people must have felt as they tried to keep up with more than 600 rules from the Old Testament and many more that had been imposed on them by the religious leaders of their day
And imagine their surprise when Jesus simplified the pursuit of righteousness by narrowing the list down to just two love the Lord your God and love your neighbor as yourself
In essence, Jesus is telling us that the way God knows we love Him is by how we treat people
All of them
Let's face it, loving our neighbor can be a challenge
But when we do it to express our love to God, we unleash a powerful motivation that loves whether the person deserves it or not
And as we love God and our neighbor, everything else falls into place
If I love my neighbor, I won't bear false witness against him, covet his wealth or his wife, or steal from him
Loving others for God's sake even provides the grace and strength to forgive those who have heaped injustices upon us
Who needs to see God's love today through you
The more unlovable the person, the greater the statement about how much you love God!
Every year when May rolls around in Michigan, I want to stop the clock
I rejoice when death is defeated by fragile sprouts that refuse to be confined by hardened clay and brittle branches
Over a few weeks, the naked landscape transforms into fully clothed trees adorned by bright, fragrant flowers
I can't get enough of the sights, sounds, and scents of springtime
I want time to stop moving
Also in May, I come to 1 Kings in my Bible reading schedule
When I get to chapter 10, I have the same feeling: I want the story to stop
The nation of Israel has bloomed
Solomon has become king and has built a magnificent dwelling place for God, who moved in with a blaze of glory
Finally united under a righteous king, they are at peace
I love happy endings
But the story doesn't end there
But King Solomon loved many foreign women, and 'his wives turned his heart after other gods
Just as the seasons of the year continue, so do the cycles of life, birth and death, success and failure, sin and confession
Although we have no power to stop the clock while we're enjoying good times, we can rest in God's promise that eventually all bad times will end.
Paul said in Romans 5:20, Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more
But that radical concept opens a theological floodgate
The biblical writer Jude warned that it is possible to 'change the grace of our God into a license for immorality'
Why be good if you know you will be forgiven
Not even an emphasis on repentance erases this danger completely
In Romans 6, Paul spoke directly to the point
Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound
He gave a short, explosive answer: Certainly not
and used an analogy that starkly contrasts death and life
How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
No Christian resurrected to new life should be pining for sin
Yet wickedness does not always seem to have the stench of death about it
Sin can be downright appealing
Paul recognized this, so he advised: Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord, and 'Do not let sin reign in your mortal body
If we truly grasped the wonder of God's love for us, we would spend our days trying to fathom and share, not exploit, His grace.
For all of us who, like Job, have suffered through tragedy and then dared to aim our questions at God, chapter 38 of Job's book should give us plenty to think about
Imagine what it must have felt like for the great man of the East when out of the whirlwind he heard God say, Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge
Now prepare yourself like a man; 
I will question you, and you shall answer Me'
Job must have felt as puny as an ant
As God unveiled His questions in the verses that follow, what He said was as unexpected as it was powerful
Instead, God seemed to be telling him to notice the power and might with which He created this world and to observe His ability to control every element of it
Isn't that reason enough to trust God
Job should have been asking himself
As one example of His awesome power, God pointed to the sky and told Job to observe two of His awe-inspiring creations: Pleiades and Orion
Highlighting His grandeur and man's relative insignificance, God mentioned two constellations that demonstrate power beyond our understanding
This is Someone we can trust
If He has the stars in His hands, surely He can take care of us as well.
Recently, I listened to an audiobook by a militant advocate for atheism
As the author himself read his own work with spiteful sarcasm and contempt, it made me wonder why he was so angry
The Bible tells us that a rejection of God can actually lead to a more hateful attitude toward Him: 'Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind
[to become] haters of God'
Turning one's back on God does not lead to secular neutrality
Indeed, recent militant atheists have shown their desire to remove any reference to a Creator from culture
When we hear about atheists trying to remove crosses or the Ten Commandments from society, it's easy to respond to their hatred of God with our own hatred
But we're exhorted to defend the truth with an attitude of love, 'in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth'
The next time you see the works or hear the words of a hater of God, do an attitude check
Then ask God for a spirit of humility and pray that the offender might come to the knowledge of the truth.
London's domed St Paul's Cathedral has an interesting architectural phenomenon called the 'whispering gallery.'
One Web site explains it this way: 'The name comes from the fact that a person who whispers facing the wall on one side can be clearly heard on the other, since the sound is carried perfectly around the vast curve of the Dome.'
In other words, you and a friend could sit on opposite sides of architect Sir Christopher Wren's great cathedral and carry on a conversation without having to speak above a whisper
While that may be a fascinating feature of St Paul's Cathedral, it can also be a warning to us
What we say about others in secret can travel just as easily as whispers travel around that gallery
And not only can our gossip travel far and wide, but it often does great harm along the way
Perhaps this is why the Bible frequently challenges us about the ways we use words
The wise King Solomon wrote, 'In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise'
Instead of using whispers and gossip that can cause hurt and pain while serving no good purpose, we would do better to restrain ourselves and practice silence.
Whenever my wife, Martie, and I get ready to go on vacation, we like to read about our destination, study the maps, and anticipate the joy of finally arriving at the place we've dreamed about for so long
For those of us who know Jesus Christ, we have an incredible destination ahead of us heaven
But I find it interesting that a lot of us don't seem to be very excited about getting there
Why is that
Maybe it's because we don't understand heaven
We talk about streets of gold and gates of pearl, but what is it really like
What is there to look forward to
I think the most profound description of heaven is found in Paul's words to the Philippians
He said that to depart and be with Christ is far better
It's what I told my 8-year-old grandson when he asked what heaven is like
I started by asking him, 'What is the most exciting thing in your life?'
He told me about his computer game and other fun things he likes to do, and then I told him that heaven is far better
He thought for a minute, and then said, Papa, that's hard to imagine.
What is it that you look forward to in life
What really excites you
Whatever it is, although it's hard to imagine, heaven will be far better!
Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life'?
It's one thing to make such a bold assertion; it's another to back it up, and back it up Jesus did by rising from the dead
'If you believe that the Son of God died and rose again,'
writes George MacDonald, 'your whole future is full of the dawn of eternal morning, coming up beyond the hills of life, and full of such hope as the highest imagination for the poet has not a glimmer yet.'
The Son of God died and rose again, and His resurrection is the guarantee that God will bring us up and out of the ground: A thinking, feeling, remembering, recognizable person will live forever
Living forever means living out the thought of eternity that God has placed in our hearts; meeting again one's believing loved ones lost through separating death; living in a world without sorrow; seeing our Lord who loves us and gave everything to unite us to Him forever
But I see another meaning
Since we have this life and the next, we don't have to have it all now
We can live in broken and ruined bodies for a time; we can endure poverty and hardship for a while; we can face loneliness, heartache, and pain for a season
Why 
There is a second birth, life in heaven forever.
In the 1980s, John Knoll and his brother Thomas began experimenting with a computer program to manipulate images
Software companies thought they were crazy, because photographers didn't use computers at that time
Initially the brothers called their program Display, then Imaginator, and finally they settled on Photoshop
Today Photoshop is used by amateurs at home and professionals in business around the world
A San Jose Mercury News article noted its place in popular language
When something looks too good to be true, people say, 'It must have been Photoshopped.'
On the first Easter morning, the women who took spices to anoint the body of Jesus found the tomb empty and heard angels say, 'He is not here, but is risen!'
When the women told this to the disciples, 'Their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them'
Nonsense
Mind-boggling
If someone manipulated the evidence, then millions of people around the world gather today to celebrate a myth
But if Jesus conquered death, then all He said about forgiveness, power to change, and eternal life is real
Because Christ has risen and lives today, this news is too good not to be true!
Many of America's 30 million white-tailed deer find themselves endangered not by guns, but by the cars of our expanding suburbs
I was reminded of their plight when a mature doe dashed through traffic just ahead of me
As I watched, I wondered what had driven her to take such a chance, and why she then stopped on the other side and looked back over her shoulder
As I drove by her, I turned to follow her gaze and saw two small fawns looking helplessly at their mother across the busy street
Instead of following, they turned and walked back into the woods
This family is not alone
We too can find ourselves in circumstances of separation and danger we did not anticipate
Reading Malachi and Matthew reminds us that we are troubled children of troubled parents who desperately need the help of our Father in heaven
Sometimes we need His help to see and avoid repeating the sins of our fathers
Sometimes we need His help to turn back to the example and care of loving parents
Only from our heavenly Father can we find the perfect forgiveness, example, and inner grace we need
He knows we are all fallen children of fallen parents 
Now He offers us the help of His Spirit and the rescue of His Son.
Sooner or later we all feel the painful effects of sin
Sometimes it's the weight of our own sin and the shame and embarrassment of having failed miserably
At other times, it's the load of someone else's sin that weighs us down, someone who betrayed, deceived, abandoned, ridiculed, cheated, or made a fool of us
Think about a time when the weight of that guilt or pain was so heavy that you couldn't pull yourself out of bed
Now try to imagine the heaviness of the combined grief that everyone's sin has caused your family, your church, your neighborhood
Add to that all the suffering sin has caused everyone in your city, state, nation, and the world
Now try to imagine the accumulated grief that sin has caused throughout the centuries since creation
Is it any wonder that the weight of all this sin began squeezing the life out of Jesus on the night He was called to bear it
The next day, even His beloved Father would forsake Him
No other suffering can compare
Sin put Jesus to the ultimate test
But His love endured it, His strength bore it, and His power overcame it
Thanks to Jesus' death and resurrection, we know beyond a doubt that sin will not and cannot win.
How should we handle moments of faith-failure, when we've damaged the kingdom of God in the eyes of our friends and family or dishonored God in our actions
We can learn from King David after his humiliation in the Bathsheba scandal
Though the terrible consequences of that sin could not be avoided, he found his way back to a relationship with God that made it possible for him to continue to serve Him
We too can find our way back
David's pattern in 2 Samuel 12 serves us well: We need to declare our error candidly and seek God's forgiveness
Then we can ask God that others be spared the consequences of our actions
Finally, we need to recognize that sometimes the consequences simply cannot be avoided and must be endured
While we always mourn those consequences, we can't allow them to so consume us that we cease to be servants of God
Satan not only delights in the moment of our failure but also in the spiritual inactivity that sometimes snares us in our remorse
When we've blown our witness, we are and should be humbled
But we should not multiply the damage by retreating into silence and obscurity as ambassadors of Christ
We can move past failure.
A young man facing the future and unsure of what the next year would bring, concluded, 'Nobody knows what God's will is.'
Is he right
Does a lack of certainty about the future translate into not knowing God's will
The concept of knowing God's will is often limited to discerning what specific situation we will be in at some future time
Although seeking God's specific leading is part of it, another aspect that is just as vital is to follow the clearly defined elements of God's will each and every day
For instance, it is God's will for us to be good citizens as a challenge to those opposed to Christ , to give God thanks no matter what, to be sanctified sexually, avoiding immorality, to live under the Holy Spirit's control, to sing to Him, and to submit to other believers
As we submit to God in these and other areas, we are more likely to live in what Romans 12:2 calls God's 'good and acceptable and perfect will
Living with God's smile of approval leads to His guidance for the future
As we seek to know God's will for the future, we must also act on what we already know now.
November 9, 2010, marked the 21st anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall
On that day in 1989, an announcement over East German TV informed people that they were free to travel to West Germany
A day later, East German bulldozers began to dismantle the wall that for 28 years had divided East and West Germany
Jesus Christ has broken down the middle wall of separation between Jew and Gentile
But there was an even more impenetrable barrier that separated man from God
Jesus' death and resurrection made the reconciliation between man and man and between man and God possible
All believers are now members of the household of God
Together, we are to grow into a holy temple in the Lord with God's Holy Spirit living among and within us
But sadly, Christians often re-erect walls between one another
That is why Paul urges us to 'walk worthy of the calling
bearing with one another in love, 
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
Rather than building walls, let's work to dismantle what separates us
Let the world see that we are indeed of the same household.
When I was growing up, we often sang a song in Sunday school that went like this: 'God is good to me
God is good to me
He holds my hand and helps me stand
God is good to me!'
I need to say right away that I believe God is good and He takes delight in doing good things for people
He does indeed hold our hand in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life's difficulties
But I wonder if you've ever asked yourself, Why is He good
It certainly is not because we deserve it or because He feels the need to buy our love and allegiance with His benefits
The psalmist prays for God to bless him so that '[the Lord's] way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations'
God's daily blessings are proof positive that He is indeed a good God who cares for His own
But how will our world know this about God if we never praise Him for His goodness to us
So, the next time God blesses you, be sure to look for ways to appropriately give Him the credit
Consuming His blessings without communicating His goodness shortchanges the very purpose of His gifts of grace in our lives.
Imagine standing shoulder to shoulder with onlookers by a dirt road
The woman behind you is on her tiptoes, trying to see who is coming
In the distance, you glimpse a man riding a donkey
As He approaches, people toss their coats onto the road
Suddenly, you hear a tree crack behind you
A man is cutting down palm branches, and people are spreading them out ahead of the donkey
Jesus' followers zealously honored Him as He entered Jerusalem a few days before His crucifixion
The multitude rejoiced and praised God for all the mighty works they had seen
Jesus' devotees surrounded Him, calling out, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!'
Their enthusiastic honor affected the people of Jerusalem
When Jesus finally arrived, 'all the city was moved, saying, '\sWho is this
Today, people are still curious about Jesus
Although we can't pave His way with palm branches or shout praises to Him in person, we can still honor Him
We can discuss His remarkable works, assist people in need , patiently bear insults, and love each other deeply
Then we must be ready to answer the onlookers who ask, Who is Jesus?
During summer training camp, the coaches on one football team wore T-shirts intended to urge their players to exert maximum effort
The shirts bore the motto, Each day you must choose: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret
Discipline is tough, and something we may try to avoid
But in sports and in life, short-term pain is often the only path to long-term gain
In the heat of battle it is too late to prepare
That's the pain of regret
One source defines regret as 'an intelligent and emotional dislike for personal past acts and behaviors.'
It's painful to look back at our choices through the lens of regret and feel the weight of our failures
This was the case for the psalmist
After a personal episode of sin and failure, he wrote, 'Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he who trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him'
In the clarity of hindsight, he saw the wisdom of a life that strives to honor the Lord, a life that does not need to be marked by regret
May our choices today not result in regret, but rather be wise and God-honoring.
In April 2010, clouds of ash spewed by a volcano in Iceland closed airports across the UK and Europe for 5 days
Nearly 100,000 flights were canceled and millions of passengers around the world found themselves in an enormous holding pattern on the ground
People missed important events, businesses lost money, and no one knew when it would end
When our plans fall apart and there is no remedy, how do we deal with frustration and delay
Isaiah 26:3-4 is an anchor for our souls in every storm of life: 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You
Trust in the Lord forever, for in [Jehovah], the Lord, is everlasting strength
Whether we're facing annoying inconvenience or heartbreaking loss, this rock-solid promise is worth memorizing and repeating every night when we close our eyes to sleep
Today, when plans are shattered, do our minds dwell on the circumstances or on the Lord
During frustrating delay, can we still trust the loving heart of God
In the hymn Like a River Glorious,Frances Havergal so beautifully expressed what we long for.
In his book Life After Heart Surgery, David Burke recalls his close brush with death
Lying in his hospital bed after a second open-heart surgery, he found himself in incredible pain, unable to draw a full breath
Feeling that he was slipping toward eternity, he prayed one last time, trusting God and thanking Him for forgiveness of his sin
David was thinking about seeing his dad, who had died several years earlier, when his nurse asked how he was feeling
He replied, I'm okay now, explaining he was ready to go to heaven and meet God
Not on my shift, buddy
she said
Soon the doctors were opening his chest again and removing two liters of fluid
That done, David began to recover
It's not unusual for any of us to ponder what it will be like when we face our final moments on earth
But those who die in the Lord have the certainty that they are blessed and that their death is precious in the sight of the Lord
God fashioned our days even before we existed, and we exist now only because the breath of the Almighty gives [us] life'
Though we don't know how many breaths we have left, we can rest in the knowledge that He does.
Sourdough bread became popular during the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s
In the 1890s, it was a favorite during the great Gold Rush in Alaska
Prospectors would carry with them a small portion of sourdough mix that contained a natural yeast
It could then be used as a starter to make more of their favorite sourdough bread
In the Bible, though, yeast or leaven can have a negative connotation
For example, in the New Testament, leaven is often referred to as a corrupting influence
This is why Jesus said: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy
Hypocrites put on a show of righteousness while hiding sinful thoughts and behavior
Christ warned His disciples and us that secret sins will someday be exposed to full disclosure
He said, 'There is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known'
Because of this, we are to reverentially fear God, to ask for His grace to forsake any sin, and to grow as authentic believers
Yeast may be a blessing in the bakery, but it can also remind us to guard against the permeating influence of sin in our hearts.
The road was smooth and we were making good progress as we headed for Jay's dad's house in South Carolina
As we drove through the mountains in Tennessee, I began seeing detour signs
But Jay kept going, so I assumed that they didn't apply to us
Shortly before we reached the North Carolina border, we came to a sign that said the highway ahead was closed due to a rock slide
We would have to turn around
Jay was surprised, Why wasn't there any warning
There were lots of warnings, I said
Didn't you see the signs
No, he said, why didn't you mention them
I assumed that you saw them, I answered
We now tell this story to entertain our friends
Throughout history, God provided plenty of signs to show people the way to live, but they kept going their own way
When God finally sent His Son as a sign , the religious leaders paid little attention to His warnings
Life for them was good
They were recognized and respected
They resented being told that they were wrong
We can be the same way
When life is going well, we tend to ignore warnings that we need to turn around and change our sinful ways
It's important to remember that we may be wrong even though life is good.
But some charities are finding that pennies add up to significant sums, and that children are generous givers
As one participant said, Small contributions can make a huge difference.
The Bible account of David and Goliath describes a seemingly insignificant person whose confidence in God was greater than any of the powerful people around him
When David volunteered to face the giant Goliath, King Saul said, You are not able to go against this Philistine
But David had faith in the Lord who had delivered him in the past
If he had listened to the pessimism of Saul or the threats of Goliath, he would have done nothing
Instead, he acted with courage because he trusted God
It's easy to feel like a penny in a trillion-dollar deficit
But when we obey the Lord in every circumstance, it all adds up
Collectively, our acts of faith, large or small, make a big difference
Two young brothers sat on the front row in church every Sunday, observing their dad as he led the worship service
One night after sending the boys to bed, the dad overheard one of his boys crying
He asked him what was wrong, but the boy was hesitant to answer
Finally, he confessed, 'Daddy, the Bible says we're going to worship God in heaven forever
That's an awfully long time
Because he pictured heaven as one long worship time with his dad up front leading, heaven sounded pretty boring to him
While I sometimes wish we had more information about what heaven will be like, we know this for sure: boring can't possibly be the right word to describe it
We will see beauty like we've never seen before, including 'a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal'
We will experience the glory of God, which will illuminate heaven
And we will enjoy a life without pain or sorrow
Yes, we will definitely worship in heaven
People 'out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation will rejoice in praising Jesus, the worthy Lamb who died for us and rose again
We will bask in the glory of the Lord's presence forever
But not for one second will we be bored!
The prophet Isaiah draws a picture for us in Isaiah 46 of the siege of Babylon and the evacuation of its idols
The carts and carriages that carry them creak, and the weary animals groan under the load
In contrast, Isaiah says that God carries His children from birth
Even to your old age, I am He, and even to gray hairs I will carry you, God declares
The contrast is precise and vivid in the Hebrew text: The carts and carriages are loaded with the weight of the idols, but we are loaded upon God
Idols are a burden, a thing carried, but God has gladly carried us from the womb
The Lord has made us
Nothing could be more comforting, for our Father loves and cares for His children
He promises, I will carry you
and that includes every care and worry that comes our way throughout our lifetime
So we may let Him carry us and our every burden
This song by Annie Johnson Flint challenges us to experience God's care: Fear not that thy need shall exceed His provision, 
Our God ever yearns His resources to share
Lean hard on the arm everlasting, availing
Thy Father both thee and thy load will upbear
Of all my childhood memories, one stands out above the others
While I have no idea what my teacher said, I clearly remember telling her to 'shut up.'
She sent me home, so I got up and left my kindergarten class to walk the half-block home
Walking down the sidewalk, I saw my mother weeding in the garden behind our house
I was now faced with a strategic decision, continue on my way and tell my mother why I was home early from school, or turn around and go back to face my teacher
When I returned to the classroom, I was immediately escorted to the restroom where my teacher washed my mouth out with soap
That kind of discipline probably wouldn't happen today
but take it from me, it was effective
To this day I am acutely sensitive about the impact of my words
God is passionately interested in our positive growth as His children
At times He needs to confront us with unpleasant circumstances to catch our attention and reorient our lives to more consistently produce the 'peaceable fruit of righteousness'
Don't resist God's corrective hand
Respond to His reproofs with thankfulness that He loves you enough to care about what kind of a person you are becoming.
Superstars abound in today's culture
Great soccer players can create such excitement that fans have been known to riot in the bleachers
Popular musicians have fans who stand with adoration throughout entire concerts
And Hollywood celebrities hire bodyguards to protect themselves from adoring stalkers
The first-century Corinthian believers had become divided over their own 'spiritual superstars.'
Paul viewed such favoritism as a reflection of the sinful nature in a believer's unyielded heart
For when one says, \sI am of Paul, and another, \sI am of Apollos, are you not carnal he asked
The apostle's teaching on how we view Christian leaders puts the topic in a biblical perspective that provides mutual appreciation for those who minister: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase
Each person did his part: Paul had planted spiritual seed through evangelism, and Apollos had watered it with his eloquent Bible teaching
But it was God alone who made the seed of spiritual life grow
He alone is the superstar
We should be careful not to put any Christian leader on a pedestal
Instead, let's appreciate how God is using a variety of spiritual leaders for His honor and His glory.
One afternoon Angela gave her young daughter four jellybeans and let her know that was all the candy she was going to receive
After practically inhaling the first three candies, Eliana lingered over the final one
She sucked on it, took it out of her mouth, bit into it, sucked on it some more, then gnawed at the outer shell
Knowing that this was her last jellybean, she took a full 45 minutes to ingest the treat completely
Angela observed her little girl with amusement
It occurred to her that she was watching Eliana learn the value of savoring, enjoying taste and texture and learning to draw out every possible bit of flavor from the pleasurable experience
When we read, 'Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good'
we can be sure that God wants us to savor His presence
He allows us to gain intimate and satisfying knowledge of Him
And when we meditate on His Word, we will draw out a deeper understanding of who He is
As we taste His goodness and love, He will reveal the distinctive flavor of His creativity, sovereignty, holiness, and faithfulness
Our Father must look on with enjoyment as we learn how to enjoy and savor Him.
Felipe Massa of Brazil should have won the Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore in September 2008
But as he drove off from a refueling stop while in the lead, the fuel hose was still attached
By the time his team removed the hose, he had lost so much time that he finished 13th
The apostle Paul warned Timothy of another kind of attachment that would cause him defeat, the affairs of this life
He urged Timothy not to let anything slow him down or distract him from the cause of his Lord and Master
There are many attractive things in our world that are so easy to get entangled with' hobbies, sports, TV, computer games
These may start off as refueling
activities, but later they can take up so much of our time and thought that they interfere with the purpose for which God created us: to share the good news of Christ, serve Him with our gifts, and bring glory to Him
Paul told Timothy why he ought not be entangled with this world's affairs: So that he could 'please Him'
If your desire is to please the Lord Jesus, you will want to stay untangled from the world
As John reminds us, 'The world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever'
Every year I have a physical, that periodic visit to the doctor's office where I'm poked and prodded, screened and studied
It is something that can be easy to dread, and even to fear
We aren't sure what the tests will show or what the doctors will say
Still, we know that we need this evaluation to understand our physical well-being and what is needed as we move forward
The same is true spiritually in the life of the Christ-follower
We need to pause from time to time and reflect on the condition of our hearts and lives
One place for an important self-study is at the Lord's Table
Paul wrote to the Corinthians, some of whom were eating in an unworthy manner: Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup
In the remembrance of Christ's death for us, there can be a sobering clarity of thought and understanding, for as we consider the price Jesus paid for us, it is the best time to consider the condition of our heart and our relationships
Then, with honest understanding of our spiritual well-being, we can turn to Him for the grace we need to move forward in His name
Is it time for your checkup?
One US Army colleague said: 'I have never come across another general officer who was so compassionate and so concerned about the well-being of soldiers and their families.'
After losing one son to suicide and another who was killed in action, Mark and his wife, Carol, dedicated themselves to helping soldiers and their families cope with service-related stress, depression, and loss
In the book of Acts, a follower of Christ was well known for his care and concern toward others
His name was Joseph, but in the early church, the apostles called him Barnabas son of encouragement.
It was Barnabas who vouched for the newly converted Saul when others doubted the sincerity of his faith
Later, Barnabas brought Saul from Tarsus to teach the believers in Antioch
And it was Barnabas who wanted to give John Mark a second chance after his failure on a previous missionary journey
Compassion is an inner feeling resulting in outward action
It should be our daily uniform of service
By God's grace, may we be known for it.
The eaglets were hungry, and Mom and Dad seemed to be ignoring them
The oldest of the three decided to solve his hunger problem by gnawing on a twig
Apparently it wasn't too tasty, because he soon abandoned it
What intrigued me about this little drama, which was being broadcast by webcam from Norfolk Botanical Garden
a big fish lay just behind the eaglets
But they had not yet learned to feed themselves
They still relied on their parents to tear their food in tiny pieces and feed it to them
Within a few weeks, however, the parents will teach the eaglets how to feed themselves, one of their first survival lessons
If the eaglets don't learn this skill, they will never be able to survive on their own
The author of Hebrews spoke of a similar problem in the spiritual realm
Certain people in the church were not growing in spiritual maturity
They had not learned to distinguish between good and bad
Like the eaglet, they hadn't learned the difference between a twig and a fish
They still needed to be fed by someone else when they should have been feeding not only themselves but others as well
While receiving spiritual food from preachers and teachers is good, spiritual growth and survival also depend on knowing how to feed ourselves.
On a teaching trip outside the US, my wife and I were denied entry into our country of destination because of visa problems
Although we were under the assumption our visas had been correctly issued by the country we planned to visit, they were deemed invalid
Despite the efforts of several government officials, nothing could be done
We weren't allowed in
We were placed on the next flight back to the States
No amount of intervention could change the fact that we did not have the proper validation for entrance
That experience with my visa was inconvenient, but it can't begin to compare with the ultimate entry rejection
I'm speaking of those who will stand before God without valid entry into heaven
What if they were to present the record of their religious efforts and good deeds
That would not be enough
What if they were to call character references
That wouldn't work
Only one thing can give anyone entry into heaven
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life
No one comes to the Father except through Me
Christ alone, through His death and resurrection, paid the price for our sins
And only He can give us valid entry into the presence of the Father
Have you put your faith in Jesus
Make sure you have a valid entry into heaven.
Most of us have wanted something so badly that even though we knew it was wrong
Later we have felt sorrow for our spiritual stubbornness and stupidity
In the aftermath of willfully disobeying God, we may become angry with ourselves, numbed by regret, or resigned to the consequences of our foolish mistake
But there is another choice
When the people of Israel insisted on having a king despite the warnings of Samuel the prophet , God allowed them to have their way
But when they realized the tragic results of their choice, they asked for Samuel's help and prayers
Samuel told the people, 'Do not fear
You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart'
We can't undo yesterday, but we can act today to influence tomorrow
Samuel promised to pray for them and teach them the right way
He urged them, Only fear the Lord, and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you
God invites us to serve Him today, humbly acknowledging His forgiveness and His faithfulness.
John Wayne, famous American actor and film icon, once said, 'Talk low, talk slow, and don't say too much.'
His advice is hard for me to follow since I'm a fast talker and I don't always speak quietly or limit my words
However, this idea of controlling our speech can be a useful tool when dealing with anger
The Bible says we are supposed to be slow to speak, and that 'a soft answer turns away wrath'
Gideon gave a soft answer during a verbal scuffle with some fellow Israelites
Just after his army defeated the Midianites, a group of his countrymen criticized him sharply
They were miffed because they missed out on the main part of the battle
Gideon did not fling back a rough response
Instead, he reminded them that they had captured and killed the Midianite princes
He also honored the men by asking, What was I able to do in comparison with you
Finally, 'their anger toward him subsided when he said that
With the Lord's help, we can defuse heated situations by reining in our words
Responding gently and carefully to angry people can promote unity, for God's glory.
At the 2009 Kansas high school state track championship, an unusual thing happened
The team that won the girls 3,200-meter relay was disqualified
But what happened next was even more unusual
The team that was awarded the state championship by default turned right around and gave their medals to the team that had been disqualified
The first school, St
Mary's Colgan, lost first place because judges ruled that a runner had stepped out of her lane as she handed off the baton
That meant the second team, Maranatha Academy, moved up to first
After receiving their medals, the girls from Maranatha saw the downtrodden looks on the faces of the St
Mary's girls, so they gave them their individual medals
Why did they do this
As Maranatha's coach Bernie Zarda put it: 'Our theme for the year was to run not for our glory, but for God's glory.'
As a result of the girls' action, their story was told throughout Kansas, and God's name was lifted up
When we set aside our own interests and accomplishments to recognize that it's better to care for the interests of others , we see God's name glorified
Acting with grace and kindness toward others is one of the best ways to point people to God.
Some say that theology is only for 'professionals.'
But the situation in the days of the prophet Jeremiah illustrates why it's important for everyone to know what God says about Himself
The religious experts in Jeremiah's day were misrepresenting God by prophesying 'the delusions of their own minds and leading people astray with their lies
Due to their dishonesty, the people did not know the true nature of God
Today there are people who portray God as angry, vengeful, and eager to punish people for every minor offense
God, however, describes Himself as 'merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth'
Others show the world a picture of a loving God who is too kind to punish wrongdoing
But God describes Himself as one who exercises judgment and righteousness
He is both a just Judge and a loving Father
If we emphasize one over the other, we paint a false picture of God
The most important thing we can know about God and proclaim to the world is that God does not want to punish people; He wants them to repent so that He can forgive
But to be truly loving, He must also be absolutely just.
On one of Christopher Columbus' voyages, he found that his crew's food supply was almost depleted
Anchored off the island of Jamaica, he was grateful to be given food by the islanders
But as time went on, the gifts of food decreased so that the crew began to starve
Columbus knew from an astronomy book that a lunar eclipse would soon occur
He called the native chiefs together and told them God was angry about their selfishness and would blot out the moon
At first the islanders scoffed
But when they watched the night's silver disc slowly become dark, they became terrified and quickly brought food
Columbus said that if he prayed, the moon would be restored
Though we may empathize with his circumstances, message from God was dishonest and self-serving
The apostle Paul wrote, We are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God
At all times we must be on guard not to misrepresent God's message to acquire what we want from others
With a heart yielded to God, we must honestly share spiritual truths that will benefit those who hear.
It's my duty to grill the burgers, brats, steaks, or whatever else my wife has on the menu
And while I'm not the greatest chef when it comes to outdoor cooking, I love the unforgettable aroma of grilling over a charcoal fire
So the mention of a fire of coals in John 21:9 catches my attention
And I find myself wondering why John would include this detail in the story about Jesus calling a failing Peter back to serve and follow Him
In verses 1-3, it's apparent that Peter had reopened his fishing business
Just a few days before, Peter was warming his hands over a charcoal fire when he denied Jesus to save his own skin
So why not go back to fishing
While Peter and his cohorts were casting nets, Jesus built a fire on the beach
Coincidence
I doubt it
And as Peter approached Jesus, I wonder if the pungent aroma of the burning charcoal brought back memories of that other fire where he had failed Christ
Yet Jesus in His mercy took the initiative to call Peter back into His service
Think of it: Jesus is willing to forgive our failures and call us into His service
After all, if only perfect people qualified to serve Him, He wouldn't have anyone to choose from!
Of His words recorded in the Bible, Jesus has more to say on money than any other topic
Luke 12 offers a good summary of His attitude
He does not condemn possessions, but He warns against putting faith in money to secure the future
Money fails to solve life's biggest problems
Although Jesus speaks to many aspects about money, He seems to concentrate on the question: What is money doing to you
Money can dominate a person's life, diverting attention away from God
Jesus challenges us to break free of money's power, even if it means giving it all away
Jesus urges His listeners to seek treasure in the kingdom of God, for such treasure can benefit them in this life and the next one too
Do not worry, He says , for God is the one who provides for our needs
And then to emphasize His point, He brings up King Solomon, the richest man in the Old Testament
Jesus said that a common wildflower is clothed more gloriously by God than a royal king
So do not have an anxious mind , 'but seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you'
Better to trust in the God who lavishes care on the whole earth than to spend our lives worrying about money and possessions.
When I visited Mexico, I wished I knew how to speak Spanish
I could say gracias, muy bien, and hola
But that was about it
I grew tired of just saying gracias to everyone who talked with me or did something for me
But we should never grow tired of giving words of thanks to God
David knew the importance of saying thanks
After he became king over Israel and had a tent constructed to house the ark of the covenant , he appointed some of the Levites 'to commemorate, to thank, and to praise the Lord'
Many people remained there to offer sacrifices and give thanks to God daily
David also committed to Asaph and his associates a song of thanks
His psalm gave thanks for what the Lord had done: 'His deeds among the peoples', 'His wondrous works', 'His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth', and His 'salvation'
David's song also gave praise for who the Lord was: good, merciful, and holy
Like David, we should never grow tired of saying gracias to God for who He is and for all He's done for us
Take time today to offer your sacrifice of praise to Him.
My family and I live in an apartment, so our flower garden consists of what we can grow in indoor pots
For a long time our plants would not flower despite watering and fertilizing
Then we discovered that the soil had to be raked and turned over if the plants were to bloom
Now our potted plants are a pure joy to look at with their healthy leaves and blooming flowers
Sometimes we need a little raking and turning in our own lives to make us bloom
Writing to the harassed believers in his day, Peter said, Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice
Like the soil in our potted plants, these Christians were having their lives turned over
God's purpose in doing that was to allow their faith to result in praise and glory to Him at the revelation of Jesus Christ
God wants to loosen the things that can choke our lives and that prevent us from radiating joy
To do this, He sometimes has to allow pain and trouble, trials that help stir up the soil of our lives
If this is what you are experiencing today, rejoice
Surrender to His touch and acquire a joy and fruitfulness you never imagined possible.
During a time of economic crisis and depressing news, two students at Purdue University decided to lift the spirits of people on campus with some encouraging words
For two hours every Wednesday afternoon, Cameron Brown and Brett Westcott stood along a busy walkway holding a large Free Compliments sign and saying nice things to everyone who passed by
I like your red coat
Cool snow boots
Very nice smile
Some students said they deliberately walked past the compliment guys every Wednesday just to hear a kind word
I was struck by these two young men who looked at people with the goal of commending them, rather than finding fault or being critical
Is that how I, as a follower of Christ, view others each day
Instead of being like the person who is focused on evil and whose speech is like a burning fire, we can take a different approach, knowing that what we say begins deep inside us
The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, and adds learning to his lips
Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the bones
Kind words may be free, but they give a priceless lift of spirit
Why not encourage someone today
Not long ago, our friends had a gathering at their house and invited a group of people who were all music lovers
Kevin and Ilse, who are both gifted musicians, requested that each person or couple bring a rock for a fire pit that was often the site for their evening musical jams
But they didn't want just plain ol' rocks
They asked that each one be marked with a name or date or event that indicated how or when everyone had become friends
God felt that the Israelites needed a reminder of an amazing event in their lives
Although the Jordan River had been at flood stage, the Israelites had been able to cross over on dry ground because God had stopped the water from flowing
Something similar had happened years before in an escape from Egypt
On this occasion, however, God instructed His people to build a memorial of stones so that in the future when children would ask about the stones, parents could remind them of the mighty hand of God
As God continually cared for the Israelites, He continues to provide for us today
What stones of remembrance will you use to remind your children, grand children and even yourself of the evidence of God's might?
When I played American football as a kid
One thing that took some getting used to was all the equipment we had to wear
Running effectively in a helmet, shoulder pads, and a variety of other protective items can feel awkward and clumsy at first
But over time the protective gear becomes like a familiar friend that provides welcome protection against serious injury
When a football player suits up, he knows that his equipment is designed to protect him in battle against a dangerous opponent
As followers of Christ, we also face a dangerous foe a spiritual enemy who seeks our downfall and destruction
Fortunately, our Lord has provided us with protection
He challenges us to suit up for spiritual battle
In Ephesians 6:13, we read, 'Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.'
Paul then describes our armor, helmet, breastplate, shield, sword, belt, and shoes
These pieces of spiritual equipment are effective only if we put them on and use them, even if they might feel uncomfortable at first
Faithfulness in the Word , in prayer , and in witness are critical to making our armor feel like a part of us
So suit up
The battle is on!
I have a friend whose note cards are imprinted with a picture of Rodin's The Thinker, the famous sculpture depicting a man in sober reflection
Below the picture is this inscription: 'Life is not fair.'
Indeed, it is not
And any theory that insists that this life is fair is illusory and deceptive
Despite the overwhelming unfairness of life, however, David in Psalm 37 prays that he will not retaliate but will instead rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him to bring justice to the earth in due time
For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the earth
Our wrath tends to be vindictive and punitive
God's wrath is untainted by self-interest and tempered by mercy
His wrath can even be His relentless love that brings our antagonists to repentance and faith
We must not then avenge ourselves, for it is written, \sVengeance is Mine
I will repay, says the Lord
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good'
This must begin in the heart, the wellspring from which the issues of our lives flow
May we cease from anger, forsake wrath, and wait patiently for the Lord.
Would you pray for my sister? the burly worker asked awkwardly
I eyed him suspiciously
Months earlier, muggy August heat intensified emotions in the pre-strike atmosphere of the assembly plant where I was working that summer
Managers drove production at a frenzied pace and union members resisted
During breaks, we were coached by union officials on slowing down our output
My faith and idealism got me in the doghouse because I didn't think God would accept anything but my best effort
I naively tried to explain
My co-workers' response was harassment, and this burly worker asking for prayer had been the ring leader
So now I greeted this prayer request with suspicion
His answer jarred me: Because she's got cancer,
he said gruffly, and I need someone God will hear
The bitter rancor between us eased as I prayed for his sister
Like the centurion in Luke 7, people in the storms of life don't waste time or mince words
They go directly to the people whose faith they've tagged as real
We need to be those people
Do our lives mark us as a go-to person in touch with God?
Daniel poured out his heart to God
He had read Jeremiah and rediscovered God's promise that Israel's captivity in Babylon would last 70 years
So, in an effort to represent his people before God, Daniel fasted and prayed
He pleaded with God not to delay in rescuing His people
When we pray, there are things we can know and other things we cannot
For instance, we have the assurance that God will hear our prayer if we know Him as our heavenly Father through faith in Jesus 
We know that His answer will come according to His will
But we don't know when the answer will come or what it will be
For Daniel, the answer to his prayer came in miraculous fashion, and it came immediately
While he was praying, the angel Gabriel arrived to provide the answer
But the nature of the answer was as surprising as the quick reply
While Daniel asked God about 70 years,
the answer was about a prophetic 70 weeks of years.
Daniel asked God for an answer about the here and now, but God's answer had to do with events thousands of years into the future
Focused as we are with our immediate situation, we may be shocked by God's answer
Yet we can know that the answer will be for His glory.
One of my favorite stories is about the Texas rancher who was doing agricultural consulting for a farmer in Germany
He asked the German farmer about the size of his property, to which he replied, 'About a mile square.'
When the German asked the Texan about the size of his ranch, the rancher explained that if he got in his pick-up truck at dawn and drove until sunset he would still be on his ranch
Not to be outdone, the farmer replied, I used to have an old truck like that
All joking aside, it's important to have the right perspective
Unfortunately, the Christians in Laodicea had the wrong perspective about wealth
By all appearances, they were rich
They had plenty of earthly goods and thought they needed nothing, not even Jesus
But Jesus had a different perspective
In spite of their material prosperity, He saw that they were 'wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked'
So He invited them to become truly rich by seeking what only He could provide: purity, character, righteousness, and wisdom
Let's not make the Laodicean mistake
Instead, let's keep our perspective right about what it means to be rich
True wealth is not measured by what you have but by who you are in Christ.
A friend quit two jobs to become a full-time caregiver when his adult son was seriously hurt in a car accident
That same year his wife of over 30 years contracted a terminal illness and died
Since then, he says he has no answers when his son asks why this happened to them
But, he told me of a reassuring dream he had along the way
He dreamed that he was in a place that was awash with sunlight
There were crowds of people around him, and a man was answering all of his why questions
Each answer made so much sense that he clearly understood why he was not to know the answers now
Then he was with his son in the dream
But when he tried to help him with his questions, he couldn't remember the answers
But even that seemed okay
And then he woke up
My friend's experience reminds me of another friend of God who suffered with unanswered questions
Only when God finally broke His silence and gave Job a vision of Himself in the wonder of creation did Job find something that was better than answers
Only then did Job find peace in knowing that our God has good and even wonderful reasons to trust Him.
Many people like both the sweetness and the energy they get from chocolate
Yet British auto technicians have found a surprising use for this sweet food
Scientists at the University of Warwick have built a racecar that runs on vegetable oils and chocolate
The fuel provides energy so that the car can reach top speeds of 135 mph
The Bible also records a surprising source of energy from a food
When Elijah had been used by God on Mt Carmel to call fire down from heaven, this spiritual high was followed by persecution and melancholy
In response to Elijah's depression, God sent an angel to provide food, drink, and rest for the weary prophet
The sustaining power of that food from heaven was remarkable, So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God'
Just as we need food to sustain our physical lives, we also need nourishing food for our spiritual lives
God's Word is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb and feeds our souls
It makes wise the simple and provides both nourishment and energy for life's long journey
Take time to feed on it.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias, one of the world's most powerful telescopes, sits atop an extinct volcano on La Palma, Canary Islands
Inaugurated in July 2009 by King Carlos of Spain, it offers astronomers an unusually clear view of the heavens
Located at 7,870 feet, the telescope is above the cloud cover, where the prevailing winds are dry and turbulence-free
Here, near the equator, scientists can study all of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere and part of the Southern
Jesus chose a mountainside to teach His followers about the characteristics of a life yielded to God
There He taught them that attitude, not altitude, was the key to having a clear view of the Father
Tucked into the passage known as the Beatitudes, Jesus said: 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God'
This is not just for the few who try to achieve it, but for all who will humbly receive it
To have a heart that is clean in God's eyes, we need to accept the Father's pardon through Christ His Son
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse [purify] us from all unrighteousness'
A mountaintop is a great place to see the stars, but to clearly see God requires a change of heart.
Joyful shouts filtered into our house from outside and I wanted to know what was so wonderful out there
I peeked through the curtains and watched two young boys splashing in a thick stream of water that gushed from a fire hydrant
The overflow reminded me of how God pours out blessings on His children, and how important it is to recognize that the Lord daily loads us with benefits
Although I know He has furnished countless good things for me, when the car blows a gasket, when the flu infects my family, and when relationships threaten to unravel, dissatisfaction threatens my view of God's blessings
they seem more like infrequent drips from a faucet rather than a flood of water from a hydrant
Maybe that's why in Psalm 103 David reminds us to 'forget not all His benefits'
And then, to help us, he lists a torrent of blessings for believers
He reminds us that God forgives all our iniquities, heals all our diseases, redeems our lives from destruction, crowns us with lovingkindness, and satisfies our mouths with good things
Today, let's take time to acknowledge God's abundance instead of overlooking the overflow of His blessings.
I read about a 5-minute rule that a mother had for her children
They had to be ready for school and gather together 5 minutes before it was time to leave each day
They would gather around Mom, and she would pray for each one by name, asking for the Lord's blessing on their day
Then she'd give them a kiss and off they'd run
Even neighborhood kids would be included in the prayer circle if they happened to stop by
One of the children said many years later that she learned from this experience how crucial prayer is to her day
The writer of Psalm 102 knew the importance of prayer
This psalm is labeled, 'A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the Lord.'
He cried out, 'Hear my prayer, O Lord
in the day that I call, answer me speedily'
God looks down 'from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven [He views] the earth'
God cares for you and wants to hear from you
Whether you follow the 5-minute rule asking for blessings on the day, or need to spend more time crying out to Him in deep distress, talk to the Lord each day
Your example may have a big impact on your family or someone close to you.
If there is any such thing as a universal question, it may be this: Are we there yet
Generations of children have asked it
They have then grown into adults who have to answer the same question when their children ask
Whenever I read the books of Moses, I wonder how many times he heard that question from the Israelites
Before rescuing them from slavery and leading them out of Egypt, Moses told them that the Lord would lead them to 'a land flowing with milk and honey'
He did, but first they spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness
This was no ordinary wandering, however
They were not lost; they were wandering for a purpose
After 400 years of slavery, the children of Israel needed to have their hearts, souls, and minds reoriented toward God
This was accomplished in the wilderness , but not before an entire generation died because of their disobedience
In life, it sometimes seems as if we are wandering in circles
We feel lost
We want to ask God, 'Are we there yet
How much longer?'
At such times, it helps to remember that the journey, not just the destination, is important to God
He uses it to humble us, test us, and show us what is in our hearts.
Skeptical about the usefulness of a small lunch, Andrew said to Jesus, 'What are [these five loaves and two fish] among so many?'
Yet the little lunch in the hands of Jesus turned out to be a huge blessing
So, before you think that you don't have much to offer Jesus, consider this: Edward Kimball, a Sunday school teacher in Boston, decided to visit a young man in his class to be sure he was a Christian
That day he led that man, Dwight L Moody, to the Lord
Chapman, a prominent evangelist, recruited Billy Sunday to join in his evangelistic campaigns
In turn, Sunday launched a national ministry that had great results in cities like Charlotte, North Carolina
An organization that started as a result of Sunday's revival invited evangelist Mordecai Ham to Charlotte
In one of those meetings, Billy Graham received Christ as his Savior and later became the most prominent evangelist of our time
When you think you don't have much to offer, remember Sunday school teacher Edward Kimball, who spent a Saturday afternoon reaching out to someone in his class
God has a special way of using routine faithfulness in the small things to accomplish great things!
I was fishing a local trout stream last summer, when my attention was fixed on a fish that was feeding nearby
I looked up and there on the bank I spied an acquaintance Dave Tucker
Immediately I became aware of my own performance
So it is when we turn our attention away from the activity at hand and think about ourselves
WH Auden has an engaging little poem about those who forget themselves in an activity a cook mixing a sauce, a surgeon making an incision, a clerk completing a bill of lading
He says that all 'wear the same rapt expression, forgetting themselves in a function.'
That phrase forgetting themselves in a function brings Philippians 2:3-4 to mind: 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself
Let each of you look out for the interests of others.
When I'm listening to a friend, I need to remind myself to focus on him, not to begin wondering how I look, what he thinks of me, what I should say next
Let's put others first by listening in rapt attention, concentrating on the one in front of us, forgetting ourselves.
In this age of new video technology, it might be hard to believe that some teachers still feel the best way to depict Bible stories is the low-tech flannelgraph board
I recall that my childhood Sunday school teachers used those flat boards covered with flannel, which enabled them to display cutouts of David, Daniel, Jonah, Jesus, and all the other characters
The flannelgraphs helped my teachers capture the essence of the Bible story in an artistic way
Those old-school flannelgraphs aren't the oldest graphic teaching devices, however
God has long had a kind of flannelgraph of His own, and it is called creation
God uses the marvel of creation to instruct us and to display His power
In Psalm 19:1, David wrote, 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.'
In creation, God has revealed Himself so clearly that Paul declared, 'His invisible attributes are clearly seen.'
Those who have the witness of creation are 'without excuse'
Why on the flannelgraph of God's creation, we see God's order and design
We see His power and glory
This should lead us to worship
'O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!'
John, the great apostle and the one Jesus loved, was reduced to tears
In a vision he received while imprisoned he found himself in God's throne room as future events unfolded
In heaven, John saw God hold up a sealed scroll
He wept because as he observed the glories of God's presence, he saw no one who could open the scroll, no one with the power to reveal God's final revelation and to complete the concluding chapter of history's drama
As an apostle, John had observed the power of sin in the world
He had witnessed Jesus' life and death on earth to conquer sin
He had seen Him ascend into heaven
But now he was fearful when he saw that no one was worthy to open the scroll and vanquish sin forever
Imagine the drama of what happened next
An elder approached John and said, 'Do not weep,'
and pointed him toward Someone he knew: 'Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah'
John looked, and he saw Jesus, the only One with the power to take the scroll, open the seals, and complete the story
Soon John's tears were dry, and millions of angels were proclaiming, 'Worthy is the Lamb!'
Are you crying
Behold, John's friend, Jesus
He is worthy
Turn things over to Him.
At the beginning of March, my friend began a countdown
Marked on the calendar in her office were the 20 days left until the first day of spring
One morning when I saw her, she volunteered, 'Only 12 more days!'
A few days later, Only 6
Her enthusiasm started to rub off on me, and I began to keep track as well
Just 2 more days, Jerrie
I know
she beamed
As believers, we have something to look forward to that is even more exciting than the anticipation of budding flowers and lots of sunshine after a long winter
God has made many promises in His Word, and each one has been or will be fulfilled
But the certainty that Christ will return is one of the greatest promises of all
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God
Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
and we'll be with Him forever
Although no one can know the exact day, we have God's promise that Jesus will come back
As we celebrate the spring and coming Easter season, let's encourage each other in anticipation of that day!
Whenever I read the Gospels, I identify with the disciples
Like me, they seemed slow to catch on
Jesus kept saying things like 'Don't you understand it yet?'
and Are you still so dull
Finally, however, Peter got it, at least one part of it
When Jesus asked, Who do you say that I am
Peter answered, You are the Christ
Peter was right about the who Jesus but he was still wrong about the how
When Jesus predicted His death, Peter rebuked Him for it
Jesus, in turn, rebuked Peter, Get behind Me, Satan for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men
Peter was still thinking in human ways of establishing kingdoms
One ruler would overthrow another and set up a new government
He was expecting Jesus to do the same
But Christ's kingdom was going to come in a new way through service and the sacrifice of His life
The method God uses today hasn't changed
Whereas Satan's voice tempts us to gain power, the voice of Jesus tells us that the meek will inherit the earth
To gain citizens for God's kingdom, we must follow the example of Jesus, who set aside selfish ambitions, served others, and called people to repent of their sin.
A major US newspaper has called Christopher Parkening 'the leading guitar virtuoso of our day, combining profound musical insight with complete technical mastery of his instrument.'
There was a time, however, when Parkening gave up playing the guitar professionally
At the height of his career as a classical guitarist, he retired at age 30, bought a ranch in Montana, and spent his days fly-fishing
But early retirement did not bring him the satisfaction he had hoped for
Then during a visit to California, he was invited to a church where he heard a clear presentation of the gospel
Of this he wrote, That night I lay awake, broken over my sins
I had lived very selfishly and it had not made me happy
It was then that I asked Jesus Christ to come into my life, to be my Lord and Savior
For the first time, I remember telling Him, Whatever You want me to do with my life, Lord, I'll do it
One of Parkening's favorite verses is 1 Corinthians 10:31, Therefore, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
He has taken up the guitar again, but this time with the motivation to glorify God
Each of us has been given gifts; and when we use them for God's glory, they bring satisfaction and joy.
During the 2009 college football season, University of Texas quarterback Colt McCoy began every post-game interview by thanking God for the opportunity to play
When he was injured early in the national championship game, he was forced to watch from the sidelines as his team lost
The apostle Paul experienced God's deliverance many times, but he didn't insist on things going his way
From prison in Rome he wrote to Timothy: 'I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand'
Some might say that Paul had failed to accomplish his goals and that his life was ending in defeat
But he saw it differently: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
He looked forward to an eternal crown
As we walk with God, we can praise Him for His faithfulness, win or lose.
One of my favorite television cartoons as a boy was Tom Terrific
When Tom faced a challenge, he would put on his thinking cap and work through the matter with his faithful sidekick Mighty Manfred, the Wonder Dog
Usually, those problems found their source in Tom's arch-enemy, Crabby Appleton
To this day, I remember how this villain was described on the show
He was 'Crabby Appleton, rotten to the core.'
The fact is that all of us share Crabby Appleton's primary problem, apart from Christ, we're all rotten to the core
The apostle Paul described us this way: 'There is none righteous, no, not one
There is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God'
None of us are capable of living up to God's perfect standard of holiness
Because of our condition of being separated from a holy God, He sent His Son Jesus to give Himself to die on the cross for the punishment we deserve, and then rise again
Now we can be justified freely by His grace through faith in Him
Jesus Christ has come to people rotten to the core, and makes us a new creation by faith in Him
In His goodness, He has fixed our problem completely, all the way down to our core.
Corrie ten Boom was a World War II concentration camp survivor and Christian who became a popular speaker around the world
Thousands attended her meetings as she talked about how she had learned to forgive her captors just as Christ had forgiven her sins
After each meeting, people surrounded her and heaped accolades on her for her godly qualities and thanked her for encouraging them in their walk with the Lord
Corrie said she would then return to her hotel room, get down on her knees, and present those compliments in thanks to God
She called it giving God a bouquet of praise
The Lord has given each of us gifts to use to minister to one another so that 'in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ
To whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever
We have nothing to offer others that we have not first received from the Lord
So the glory does belong to Him
To learn humility, perhaps we could follow Corrie's example
If we receive a compliment for something we've said or done, let's privately give a bouquet of praise to God for the glory He alone deserves.
Sixteen Tons written by Merle Travis and recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford, became one of America's most popular songs in the mid-1950s
People seemed to identify with this coal miner's lament about feeling trapped and unable to change his situation no matter how hard he worked
Coal miners often lived in company-owned houses and were paid in scrip coupons valid only at the company-owned store
Even if summoned to heaven, the miner said, he couldn't go because he owed his soul to the company store
That sense of hopeless resignation may help us understand the feelings of the Hebrew people during their 400 years of bondage in Egypt
When Moses told them of God's promise to release them from slavery, they didn't listen to him 'because of anguish of spirit
They were so far down they couldn't look up
But God did something for them that they could not do for themselves
The Lord's miraculous deliverance of His people foreshadowed His powerful intervention on our behalf through His Son Jesus Christ
It was when we were powerless to help ourselves that Christ died for sinful men
When life is at its lowest ebb, we are not without hope because of the wonderful grace of God.
The psalmist had seen great and severe troubles
Yet hovering in the back of his mind was the thought that God would revive him again
The literal meaning of this phrase is bring him to life again
You shall increase my greatness and comfort me on every side
If the troubles didn't end in this life, certainly in heaven they would
Perhaps no one but God knows the trouble you've seen, but this is not all that shall be
There will be comfort on every side
His presence and love will bring perfect peace and rest
Richard Baxter writes, 'O what a blessed day that will be when I shall
stand on the shore and look back on the raging seas I have safely passed; when I shall review my pains and sorrows, my fears and tears, and possess the glory which was the end of all!'?
Several years ago a friend of mine visited an exhibit of relics from the infamous Titanic voyage
Exhibit visitors were given a replica ticket with the name of an actual passenger or crew member who, decades earlier, had embarked on the trip of a lifetime
After the tour group walked through the exhibit viewing pieces of silver dinnerware and other artifacts, the tour ended with an unforgettable twist
A large board listed the names of all the passengers, including their status, first class, second class, crew
As my friend looked for the name of the person whose ticket he was holding, he noticed a line across the board dividing the names
Above the line were the names of those who were saved and below the line all those who were lost
The parallel to our life on earth is profound
It really doesn't make any difference how the world ranks your status
The only thing that ultimately matters is whether you are saved or lost
As Jesus said, 'What profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?'
Perhaps you've already trusted in Christ for your salvation
But what about your fellow passengers
Instead of sizing them up by the externals, talk to them about their ultimate destination.
Have you ever stopped to consider the amazing features God placed in the animals He created
Job did, and one of the most interesting he wrote about is the ostrich
Despite its apparent lack of good sense and its eccentric parenting skills, its offspring survive
And despite its membership in the bird family, it can't fly, but it can outrun a horse
Another remarkable creature is the bombardier beetle
This African insect shoots two common materials, hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone, from twin storage tanks in its back
Apart, these substances are harmless; together, they blind the beetle's predators
A special nozzle inside the beetle mixes the chemicals, enabling it to bombard its foe at amazing speeds
And the little guy can rotate his cannon to fire in any direction
How can this be
How is it that a rather dull-witted ostrich survives despite a seeming inability to care for its young while the bombardier beetle needs a sophisticated chemical reaction to ensure its continued presence on earth
It's because God's creative abilities know no boundaries
The psalmist tells us, He commanded and they were created
From the ostrich to the beetle, God's creative work is clear for all to see
Praise the name of the Lord
I first met my wife, Marlene, in college
I was majoring in pastoral studies, and she was working on a degree in elementary education
The first time I saw her working with children, I knew what a natural fit this was for her
She loved children
It became even more obvious when we got married and had children of our own
Seeing her with them was an education in unconditional love and acceptance
It was clear to me that there is nothing in all the world like the tender love and compassion of a mother for her newborn child
That's what makes Isaiah 49:15 so remarkable
It's here that God told His people, who were feeling forsaken and forgotten , that His compassion is even greater than a mother's: Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb
Surely they may forget, yet I will not forget you
Sometimes we face struggles in life, and we are tempted to think that God has forgotten us
We may even believe that God no longer loves us
But God's love for us is as expansive as the open arms of Christ on the cross
And the tender compassion of our heavenly Father is more dependable and more enduring than the love of a nursing mother for her infant
Be comforted, His love never fails.
In May 1884, two young parents disagreed about what middle name to give their newborn son
The mom preferred Solomon; the dad, Shippe, both family names
Because John and Martha couldn't agree, they compromised on 'S.'
Thus Harry S Truman would become the only US president with an initial for a middle name
Over 120 years later, we still know about this conflict, but we also know that a reasonable resolution was reached
In the New Testament, we read about another disagreement that has lived on in history between two missionaries: Paul and Barnabas
Barnabas wanted to take Mark with them on a trip to check on some churches they had helped previously
But Paul did not trust Mark because of an earlier incident
Paul and Barnabas disagreed so sharply that they parted ways
We still read about this argument 2,000 years later
What's important is not that it lived on in history, but that it didn't leave permanent relationship scars
Paul apparently reconciled with Barnabas, and in his final days asked for Mark to be with him because 'he is useful to me for ministry'
Arguments happen
But let's make sure they are resolved
Grudges are a burden too heavy to carry.
I used to view the worship service '\sin church as a time for entertainment
Speaking of folks like me, Sören Kierkegaard said that we tend to think of church as a kind of theater: We sit in the audience, attentively watching the actors onstage
If sufficiently entertained, we show our gratitude with applause
Church, though, should be the opposite of the theater
God is the audience for our worship
What matters most takes place within the hearts of the congregation, not onstage
We should leave a worship service asking ourselves not What did I get out of it? but rather 'Was God pleased with what happened
God took pains to specify details of animal sacrifice for the ancient Israelites in their worship
Yet He said that He didn't need their animals: 'I will not take a bull from your house, nor goats out of your folds, for every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills'
What He wanted was their praise and obedience
By focusing on the externals of worship, we too miss the point: The Lord is interested in a sacrifice of the heart, an internal attitude of submission and thanksgiving
The goal of worship is nothing less than to meet and please our God.
Not long ago, my wife, Janet, and I accepted an invitation to dine with a Christian woman who attends our Sunday school class
In her zeal to prepare a meal for us, she cut her index finger deeply
As we drove her to the emergency room, we prayed for her, and then we kept her company in the waiting room
Several hours later, our friend finally saw the doctor
After we returned to her home, our hostess insisted we stay for the meal she had prepared
What followed was a great time of lively conversation and spiritual fellowship
While we ate, she shared with us some of the heartaches she had suffered, and how through the ups and downs she had found God's wonderful grace invading her life
Later, my wife and I reflected on the unexpected trip to the hospital and the shared fellowship that had resulted
This verse came to mind: 'Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ'
By providing support for our injured hostess, she was blessed
Then afterward, she became a blessing to us through her hospitality and a delicious meal
In retrospect, painful experiences can be a marvelous gateway to rich fellowship as we 'bear one another's burdens.
I've received a lot of good advice in my life
Near the top of the list is this wise observation from a friend: 'Life is not made by the dreams that you dream but by the choices that you make.'
He's right your life today is the sum total of all the choices you've made up to this point
The apostle Paul gave similar advice in Philippians 1:10, when he said to 'approve the things that are excellent'
In any given situation, we have a whole continuum of choices, ranging from really rotten choices, to the mediocrity of average choices, to choices that are good, and then to those that are excellent
God wants to move us across the continuum, past our natural impulses, all the way to excellent choices
Often it's challenging to make the most excellent choice, especially if there aren't many others joining us
Sometimes it may feel as if our desires and freedoms have been suppressed
But if you follow Paul's advice, you'll notice some really positive outcomes, like being pure and blameless and fruitful
Make the choice to live a life filled with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control
Then revel in the result!
Medical studies have shown that even though people who have had heart-bypass surgery are told that they must change their lifestyle or die, about 90 percent do not change
Typically, 2 years after surgery the patients haven't altered their lifestyle
It seems that most would rather die than change
Just as doctors preach a physical message of change to prevent death, John the Baptist came preaching a spiritual message of change
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!
He was preparing the way for the ultimate manifestation of God's reign, the Messiah, Jesus
Repentance means to change one's mind and attitude about God, which ultimately changes a person's actions and decisions
Those who repent and accept Christ's provision of forgiveness from their sins through His death on the cross will escape spiritual death
Repentance involves confessing sin with godly sorrow, and then forsaking sin
John the Baptist was calling people to turn from one way of living to ways that honor God
Today, the Lord is still calling us to repent and then to respond with the 'fruits worthy of repentance'
Growing up in rural Missouri where American outlaw Jesse James had lived, my friends and I were convinced he had buried treasure nearby
We wandered the woods in dreamy hopes of digging up a saddlebag or other treasure
Often we'd run into an elderly man chopping firewood with a giant axe
For years, we watched this mysterious 'axe man'
trudge the highways in search of soda cans, his own kind of treasure
Redeeming the cans for cash, he'd retire to his run-down, roofless, unpainted shack with a bottle in a brown paper bag
After his death, his family found bundles of money stored in his ramshackle home
Like the axe man who ignored his treasure, we Christians sometimes ignore parts of Scripture
We forget that all of Scripture is ours to use; that each passage has a reason for its inclusion in the canon
Who knew Leviticus held so much buried treasure
In an efficient seven verses in chapter 19, God teaches us how to provide for the poor and disabled without stripping them of their dignity , how to run our businesses ethically , and how to embed respect for Him into our daily life
If a few verses can contain so much treasure, think of all that can be ours if we dig into our Bibles every day.
Why is it taking my hair so long to get dry
I wondered
As usual, I was in a hurry, and I didn't want to go outside into the wintry weather with wet hair
Then I realized the problem
I often wish I could control the conditions of life as easily as I can change the setting on my hairdryer
I would choose a comfortable setting not too hot, not too cold
I certainly wouldn't choose the heat of adversity or the fire of affliction
But in the spiritual realm, warm doesn't get the job done
We are called to holiness, and holiness often involves 'heat.'
To be holy means to be set apart for God, separated from anything unclean or impure
To refine and purify us, God sometimes uses the furnace of affliction
The prophet Isaiah said, When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; he didn't say if
And the apostle Peter said that we should not be surprised by trials
None of us knows when we'll be called to walk through the fire or how hot the furnace will be
But we do know this: God's purpose for the flames is to purify us, not to destroy us.
The social networking Web site Facebook.com was launched in 2004 as a way for college students to connect with each other online
It is now open to people of all ages, and currently there are an estimated 500 million users
Each user has an individual page with photos and personal details that can be viewed by 'friends.'
To friend a person means opening the door to communication and information about who you are, where you go, and what you do
Facebook friendships may be casual or committed, but each one is 'by invitation only.'
Just before Jesus was crucified, He told His disciples: 'You are My friends if you do whatever I command you
No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you'
Unselfishness, oneness of purpose, and confident trust are the hallmarks of true friendship, especially in our relationship with the Lord
Christ has taken the initiative by giving His life for us and inviting us to know and follow Him
Have we responded to the Lord Jesus' invitation of friendship by opening our hearts to Him with nothing held back?
Be still, and know that I am God
I will be exalted among the nations
These words from a song sung long ago at the temple in Jerusalem remind us of one of our main tasks worshiping our awesome God
One way to do that is to meditate on His many attributes
Exalt God, for He is faithful, eternal, all-knowing, just, unchangeable, gracious, holy, merciful, longsuffering, impartial, and infinite
Our God is perfect
Exalt God also by realizing that He is all-powerful, almighty, personal, righteous, unsearchable, wise, triune, accessible, self-existent, glorious, and compassionate
Another way to worship God is to contemplate His names
Exalt God, for He is Creator
He is Love
He is Redeemer
He is Shepherd
He is Savior, Lord, and Father
He is Judge
He is Comforter
He is Teacher
He is I AM
Our God is the Mighty One
Dwell on His identity
God is our shield
Our stronghold
Our light
Our strength
Our sustainer
Our rescuer
Our fortress
Meditate on God's attributes
Contemplate His names
Dwell on His identity
Adore Him
Respect Him
Honor Him
Love Him
Exalt Him
Use the rest of your life getting ready to worship our awesome God forever.
It erupts
It melts everything in its path
Its blast is as powerful as a nuclear explosion
Well, maybe not, but a temper can feel as intense as a volcano when it is aimed directly at another person in a family
The moment may be quickly over, but it can leave emotional devastation and bitter feelings behind
It's sad that the people we love the most are often the target of our hurtful words
But even when we feel we've been provoked, we have a choice
Will we respond in anger or in kindness
The Bible tells us to rid ourselves of bitterness and anger, and to 'be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you'
If you are struggling with chronic anger that is hurting your relationships, surrender this vulnerable part of your emotions to Christ's strength
Ask God to forgive you for an uncontrolled temper and to show you how to moderate your emotions and to teach you how to honor others above yourself
Seek out help from others to learn how to deal with your strong emotions in appropriate ways
As we earnestly seek to love others and to please God, we can win the victory over a volcanic temper.
Jim was sharing the gospel with Kerri
He told her she was separated from a holy God because of her sin, and that Jesus had died and risen for her salvation
She kept coming up with one reason not to believe
But if I do receive Him, I won't have to tell other people about it
I don't want to do that
She said that didn't fit her personality; she didn't want to have to tell others about Jesus
Jim explained that promising to witness about Jesus wasn't a requirement before receiving Him
But he also said that once she came to know the Lord, Kerri would become His ambassador to the world
After talking a little longer, Kerri acknowledged her need for salvation through Christ
She went home excited and at peace
Funny thing happened within 24 hours she told three people about what God had done in her life
When we're thankful, we want to share what God has done.
Susan Boyle spent most of her adult life living with her cat Pebbles, caring for her aging mother, and singing in church
She certainly didn't look like a musical superstar
That's probably why the audience laughed at this unassuming middle-aged woman before she performed in a talent show
Undeterred, Susan faced the unfriendly crowd, sang beautifully, and went on to receive a standing ovation
Stephen was confronted by a hostile crowd in the days of the early church
A panel of religious authorities listened to lying witnesses accuse him of blasphemy
Stephen responded by speaking the truth of God's Word, which reinforced his faith in Christ
At the end of his speech, he said, Look I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God
Then the crowd stoned him
Jesus who was watching from heaven, welcomed Stephen home
Most Christians aren't confronted with this much hostility
Yet we all need to stand fast in the Lord when the pressure is on
We can't let others silence our voice for Christ
Speaking up for Jesus does not always win the crowd's favor here on earth, but it does ensure His approval in heaven, where it matters the most.
Golda Meir knew both struggle and success during her life
As prime minister of Israel, she experienced many episodes of conflict and loss, as well as the periodic joy of successes and victory in the life of the fledgling State of Israel
She said of joy and sorrow, Those who don't know how to weep with their whole heart, don't know how to laugh either
The apostle Paul called us to a life of both weeping and rejoicing but with a twist
In Romans 12:15, the apostle challenged us to look outside our own experiences to the needs of others
He said, 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.'
If we rejoice only in our own victories, we miss the wonder of celebrating the power of the Lord, who desires to accomplish His purposes in and through others as well
If we mourn only our own losses, we lose the opportunity to be there for those who are hurting by showing them compassion
Life is filled with the extremes of joy and sorrow, victory and defeat
But we have been given the privilege of entering into those moments in people's lives to see the grace of God at work
Don't miss it!
Many of the first astronauts were once Boy Scouts
The scouts were good at capturing the imagination of young boys and instilling discipline to reach their goals even if it meant reaching for the stars
On July 20, 1969, the Boy Scouts were busy celebrating at a conference
During the gathering, the scouts were delighted to hear from former Eagle Scout Neil Armstrong, who sent them greetings from space
One of their own had grown up to realize a wonderful dream
In some ways, the Christian home can be like a loving, spiritual scout camp
The Bible encourages parents to provide a positive growth environment for children in the home
Parents are exhorted to 'bring [children] up in the training and admonition of the Lord
Let's strive to make our home a place where loving discipline enables the children in our charge to reach their potential for God's glory.
When our granddaughter Julia was very small, we took her on a driving trip over an Idaho mountain road
Afterward, she and her Nana were having a conversation about the adventure
I don't worry because I think Papa has a guardian angel
I think he must have a team of guardian angels, Julia replied
The mission of angels is to protect and serve the children of God
The psalmist said, The chariots of God are
thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them
God is the Lord of hosts, which means armies
The angels are the Lord's army
In 2 Kings we read about Elisha and his servant who were surrounded by the Syrian army
Elisha's servant cried out, Alas, my master
What shall we do
Elisha replied, Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.'
Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he saw that 'the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around
The Lord's army was at hand
Even though we cannot see them with our natural eyes, we can rest in the confidence that the Lord of Hosts is constantly watching over us and He has an invisible army at His bidding to send where He pleases.
A Washington Post article reported that recent studies into the nature of prejudice found that almost everyone harbors biases, and these attitudes affect even those who actively resist them
A University of Kentucky psychologist says that much of our self-esteem comes from feeling better about ourselves than about others because of the group we belong to
Prejudice is not easy to overcome, even within the family of God
Paul's words to the believers at Colosse instruct us today, saying that our speech and behavior toward fellow Christians should reflect our oneness in Christ
[You] have put on the new man, Paul said, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all
Instead of superiority and favoritism, we should demonstrate compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience toward each other
And above all, we are to 'put on love, which is the bond of perfection'
In the body of Christ, no race, nationality, or class is better than another
Through the cross, Christ has made us one, and we are to treat each other with honesty, dignity, and love.
In 1931, the city of Hayward, California, built its first permanent city hall building
Costing $100,000 at the time, the structure with its square Corinthian columns and Roman arch entry was considered a marvel
There was only one problem
It was built on the Hayward Fault and is gradually splitting in two
In 1989, an earthquake forced its closure, and it is now off limits to occupants
Building on an unstable foundation is not wise
This is also true of our spiritual lives
Jesus taught His disciples this truth with an illustration: Everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand
and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, and it fell and great was its fall
The shifting morals of our present world can be confusing
We may be tempted to let culture or the opinions of society be the foundation for the decisions we make
But obeying the unwavering truth of God's Word brings stability unavailable anywhere else
Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock'
My friend Tim Davis tells the story of being in Trinidad as a little boy when Queen Elizabeth came to visit their town
He recalls going with his missionary parents to join hundreds of others who gathered to greet the queen
Waving his little flag, he watched as the entourage came down the street, first the soldiers, then the mounted guard, and then the limousine from which she waved to the cheering crowd
He looked on as the queen drove out of town, leaving everyone to return to life as usual
In Tim's words, Royalty came to town and nothing changed
For those of us who have accepted Jesus as Savior, there was a day when royalty arrived, in our heart
As Paul put it, our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit a reality that has huge ramifications
His residence in our life is intended to transform us to live in a way that brings glory to Him
Our relationships, the way we serve our employer, how we use our money, how we treat our enemies, and everything else in our lives should reflect the wonderful reality that royalty lives within
Has anything changed since King Jesus came into your heart
Does your world notice or do they think He was just passing through?
In Singapore, the Chinese New Year season's social and business dinners often begin with a dish consisting of salads, dressings, pickles, and raw fish
The name of the dish, Yu Sheng, is a pun that sounds like 'year of prosperity.'
It is traditional for those present to toss the salad together
As they do, certain phrases are repeated to bring about good fortune
Our words may express our hopes for others for the year ahead, but they can't bring about good fortune
The important issue is, what does God want to see in us in the coming year
In his letter to the Philippians, Paul expressed his desire and prayer that their love 'may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment'
The church had been a great tower of support for him , yet he urged them to continue to grow to love others
Paul wasn't talking about intellectual knowledge but knowledge of God
Love for others starts with a closer relationship with Him
With a fuller knowledge of God, we can then discern between right and wrong
Giving our best wishes to others for the coming year is fine
But our heartfelt prayer should be that we abound in love, so that we may be filled with the fruits of righteousness
to the glory and praise of God
Every so often my computer becomes sluggish
Frequent use of certain programs and documents causes pieces of information to become scattered, requiring my computer to search for the pieces before I can use them
To fix it, I need to run a program that retrieves the pieces and groups them together where they are easily accessible
This process is called defragmentation
Like my computer, my life gets fragmented
One situation tugs on my emotions while I'm trying to concentrate on something else
Demands from every direction bombard me
I want to accomplish everything that needs to be done, but my mind won't stop and my body won't start
Soon I begin to feel weary and useless
Recently I attended a retreat where one of the handouts included a prayer with words that expressed how I felt: 'Lord, I am scattered, restless, and only half here.'
King David also went through such times
In prayer, David presented his needs to God morning, noon, and evening, confident that he would be heard
Prayer can help to defragment our lives
When we cast our cares on the Lord, He will show us what we need to do and what only He can do.
True stories about deceit and deception can sound stranger than fiction
According to an AP news item, a Georgia woman was arrested after trying to pay for more than $1,500 in purchases with a million-dollar counterfeit bill
When questioned, the embarrassed patron claimed to have been misled, saying that the fake money had been given to her by her ex-husband, who was a coin collector
The size of the bill makes us question whether anyone could really have been misled into thinking it was real
But maybe that makes it a good illustration of the almost unbelievable problem of self-deception that the prophet warns us about
When Jeremiah said, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it
he expresses a sense of amazement that is beyond our ability to grasp
Here the prophet is not saying that some of us have a problem being honest with ourselves; he is claiming that everyone does
Thankfully, God searches our hearts and understands what we cannot see
He gives us every reason to say, 'Lord, we need Your help
Please show us whether we are being honest with ourselves and You
If we aren't, help us to change and rely on You rather than on ourselves.'?
In the hectic downtown of one of Asia's great cities, I marveled at the busy sidewalks filled with people
There seemed to be no room to move in the crush of humanity, yet it also seemed that everyone was moving at top speed
My attention was drawn to the soft, almost mournful sound of a single trumpeter playing 'Amazing Grace.'
The crowds appeared oblivious to both the musician and the music
Still, he played, sending a musical message of the love of God out to whoever knew the song and would think about the words as he played
I thought of this experience as a parable
The music seemed to be an invitation to the masses to follow Christ
As with the gospel message, some believe in God's amazing grace and choose the narrow way
Others ignore His grace, which is the broad way that leads to everlasting destruction
Jesus said, 'Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it'
Jesus died so that whoever calls on His name can find forgiveness in His grace.
As an umpire stood behind the plate at a girls' softball game, he heard a player's mother start chanting: We want a new ump
We want a new ump
Soon, other parents took up the chant
The ump smiled, then turned toward the crowd and yelled, I want new parents
I want new parents
The heckling died away
It's important for parents to set a good example, because their children are watching them
Christian parents can encourage good habits and behavior by doing things like: '\s Praying for and with them, so they learn how to talk with God
Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it
Reading and teaching them the Bible so they learn God's truth
Teach [God's commands] diligently to your children and talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down and when you rise up
Telling them about Jesus and leading them to faith in Him
Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God'
The best way to set a good example for our children is to live out our faith in front of them
While they're looking, they're learning about what matters most.
SMITH magazine, an online community that 'celebrates the joy of storytelling invited readers to submit six-word memoirs that describe their lives
Thousands responded with brief biographies ranging from the light-hearted 'Sweet wife, good sons, I'm rich to the painful 'Sixty
Still haven't forgiven my parents
Based on Scripture, I tried to imagine how King Solomon might have summed up his life in six words
As a young man, he could have written: God has given me great wisdom
But in his later years, he might have said: Should have practiced what I preached
During a reign distinguished by peace and prosperity, Solomon developed spiritual heart problems
When he was old, 'his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David'
The result was God's displeasure and a sad end to a previously exemplary life
The multiple times Solomon used the word vanity in Ecclesiastes may indicate his disillusionment about life
This once-wise king who had it all, lost it all, and pondered it all, ended the book with this final conclusion: Fear God and keep His commandments
Those are six words worth heeding.
In his book A Crack in the Edge of the World, Simon Winchester writes of the small earthquake-prone town of Parkfield, California
Seeking to attract tourists, a hotel sign reads: Sleep Here When It Happens
A local restaurant menu features a large steak called The Big One and desserts are called Aftershocks
But all humor aside, a real earthquake can be a terrifying experience
I know
I've lived through California earthquakes
In the book of Acts, we read how God used an earthquake to open someone's heart to the gospel
Having been falsely accused, Paul and Silas found themselves in jail at Philippi
Around midnight, an earthquake rumbled through the prison, opening the doors and loosing the prisoners' chains
When the jailer learned that Paul and Silas had not tried to escape, he asked, 'What must I do to be saved?'
Paul responded, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household'
That night the jailer and his family believed and were baptized
And it all started with an earthquake
Sometimes life's upsets can make people more open to the gospel
Do you know anyone who is going through a crisis
Prayerfully stay in contact with them, and be ready to share a sensitive word of witness.
If you were to ask me who I am, I'd tell you that I'm a follower of Jesus
But I have to admit, at times following Him is a real challenge
He tells me to do things like rejoice when I'm persecuted ; to turn the other cheek ; to give to someone who wants to take from me ; to love my enemies, bless those who curse me, and do good to those who hate me
This kind of lifestyle seems very upside down to me
But I've come to realize that He's not upside down, I am
We have all been born fallen and broken
Being twisted by sin, our first instincts are often wrong, which inevitably leaves a big mess
We're like toast slathered with jelly that has fallen upside down on the kitchen floor
Left to ourselves, we can make a pretty big mess of things
Then Jesus comes along, like a divine spatula, scrapes us off the floor of our sinful ways, and turns us right side up
And as we follow His right-side-up ways, we discover that turning the other cheek keeps us from getting caught in a brawl, that it is more blessed to give than to receive, and that dying to self is life at its best
After all, His ways are not our ways , and I've come to realize that His ways are always best!
Ray Stedman told about a young man who had stopped attending the church Ray was pastoring
The young man said that when he was at work he would sometimes lose his temper and treat co-workers poorly
Then, when Sunday rolled around, he didn't want to go to church because he felt like a hypocrite
Stedman told his young friend, 'A hypocrite is someone who acts like something he isn't
When you come to church, you are acting like a Christian
You are not a hypocrite at church.'
Suddenly, the young man realized where he was being a hypocrite
He recognized that the answer was not in avoiding church but in changing the way he was at work
The term hypocrite is from a Greek word that means 'play-actor.'
It means we pretend to be something we aren't
Sometimes we forget our true identity as believers in Jesus
We forget that we are accountable to God
When we do that, we live the way we once walked and thus are hypocrites
Let's not let our old ways make us act like someone we're not
Instead, through God's grace, let's live in a way that shows we are 'alive together with Christ'
That's a sure cure for hypocrisy.
Fay Weldon went through what she thought was a near-death experience in 2006 when an allergic reaction stopped her heart
She retold her experience to Elizabeth Grice of the London Daily Telegraph
She said that a terrible creature tried to pull her through pearly gates, while doctors tried to pull her back
Later, she said, If that was dying, I don't want to do it again.
It's just more of the same
More struggle
Often the process of dying is a struggle
But death itself need not be feared by the believer in Christ, for it will bring us to heaven
In Revelation, John gives a wonderful description of what eternity with God will be like
He sees the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven
The city of Jerusalem was a physical sign of the people of God and was described as the place where God dwells
The New Jerusalem, on the other hand, will not be made by human hands
It will be a place where God lives with His people eternally, and it will be a place of 'no more'?, no more pain, sorrow, and sickness
We don't know very much about eternity, but we do know that for the Christian, whatever our emotional and physical struggles are now, they will cease then
Life with God will be better by far.
The Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland, has an extensive collection of ancient Bible fragments dating back to the second century AD
One fragment on display is a piece of Acts 17:16
The message that ancient fragment displays, however, is as contemporary as today's newspaper
It reads, 'While Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.'
Paul was angered by the proliferation of idols in ancient Athens, and I am convinced he would be upset with us today
Some idols that we see in today's world are different than the ones in Paul's day
Whether it's wealth, fame, power, athletes, entertainers, or politicians, contemporary idols abound
As always, our spiritual enemy, Satan, seeks to lure us away from the Savior to the false worship of idols
Christians are not immune, and thus we must guard our hearts against self-righteous anger toward unbelievers who seem to worship everything but God
We must also be drawn by Christ's love to reach out to those who don't know Him
Then, like the believers at Thessalonica, they may turn 'to God from idols to serve the living and true God'
Jack and Trisha were driving to the hospital late one night for the birth of their second child when the unexpected happened
Trisha began to deliver the baby
Jack called 911 and Cherie White, an emergency dispatcher, was able to talk Jack through the delivery
But the baby wouldn't breathe
So Cherie then instructed Jack how to give emergency breathing, which he had to do for 6 anxious minutes
Finally the newborn took a breath and cried
When asked later how they all got through the ordeal and remained calm, Cherie responded, 'I'm glad God works midnights!'
I love to hear media reports in which God gets the glory He deserves for something good that has happened
In the Bible reading for today, it's obvious that God should get the credit for parting the Red Sea to help His people escape from Pharaoh, even though Moses was the one who raised his rod
All the Israelites and Moses gathered together and sang the Lord's praises: 'Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods
Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?'
When something good happens, the Lord deserves the credit, for He is the source of all that is good
Give Him the glory
Aren't you glad He works midnights?
His face was grimy, his hair long and dirty
Beer stained his clothing and perfumed the air around him
When he stepped into the church building, the Sunday worshipers ignored him
They were stunned when the man approached the pulpit, took off his wig, and began preaching
That's when they realized he was their pastor
I don't know about you, but I tend to be friendly and shake hands with the people I know and those who pre-sent themselves well
James issued a serious warning for people like me
He said, 'If you show partiality, you commit sin'
Favoritism based on appearance or economic status has no place in God's family
In fact, it means we have 'become judges with evil thoughts'
Fortunately, we can guard against preferential treatment by loving our neighbor as ourselves, no matter who our neighbor may be
Reaching out to the homeless man, the hungry woman, or the heartbroken teen means we 'fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture'
In a world that keeps the outcast at arm's length, let's show the love of Christ and embrace the one who needs our care the most.
According to the ancient philosopher Aristotle, 'Nature abhors a vacuum.'
Aristotle based his conclusion on the observation that nature requires every space to be filled with something, even if that something is colorless, odorless air
The same principle is at work in our spiritual lives
When the Holy Spirit begins to convict us of sin, the idea of starting a self-improvement plan immediately comes to mind
We put forth our best effort to defeat our worst habits
But every attempt to get rid of unclean thoughts, attitudes, and desires is destined to fail because getting rid of one creates a vacuum in our souls
As soon as we empty ourselves of one vice, others move in to take its place
We end up just as bad or worse than when we started
Thinking about vacuums helps us to understand the importance of what Paul was saying to the Ephesians when he prayed that Christ would dwell in their hearts through faith and that they would 'know the love of Christ
that [they] may be filled with all the fullness of God'
The only permanent solution to the problem of sin in our lives is to replace it with the love of Jesus, which fills the vacuum
The more we are filled with His love, the less room there is for any evil thing.
Someone shared with me her observation about two bosses
One is loved but not feared by his subordinates
Because they love their boss but don't respect his authority, they don't follow his guidelines
The other boss is both feared and loved by those who serve under him, and their good behavior shows it
The Lord desires that His people both fear and love Him too
Today's Bible passage, Deuteronomy 10, says that keeping God's guidelines involves both
In verse 12, we are told 'to fear the Lord your God and to love Him
To fear the Lord God is to give Him the highest respect
For the believer, it is not a matter of feeling intimidated by Him or His character
But out of respect for His person and authority, we walk in all His ways and keep His commandments
Out of love, we serve Him with all our heart and with all our soul rather than merely out of duty
Love flows out of our deep gratitude for His love for us, rather than out of our likes and dislikes
We love Him because He first loved us
Our fear and love for God enable us to walk willingly in obedience to God's law.
It has become so commonplace to hear of the misconduct of a respected public figure that even though we may be deeply disappointed, we are hardly surprised
But how should we respond to the news of a moral failure, whether by a prominent person or a friend
We might begin by looking at ourselves
A century ago, Oswald Chambers told his students at the Bible Training College in London, 'Always remain alert to the fact that where one man has gone back is exactly where anyone may go back
Unguarded strength is double weakness.'
Chambers' words echo Paul's warning to be aware of our own vulnerability when we see the sins of others
After reviewing the disobedience of the Israelites in the wilderness , Paul urged his readers to learn from those sins so they wouldn't repeat them
He focused not on past failings but on present pride when he wrote, 'Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall'
The head shaken in reproach is a common response to public sin
More helpful is the head that nods, Yes, I am capable of that, then bows in prayer for the one who has fallen and the one who thinks he stands.
Because I'm a writer, occasionally a friend will say to me, I want to write a book someday
That's a worthy goal, I reply, and I hope you do write a book
But it's better to be one than to write one
I'm thinking of the apostle Paul's words: 'Clearly you are an epistle of Christ
written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart'
In his book The Practice of Piety, Lewis Bayly, chaplain to England's King James I, said that 'one who hopes to effect any good by his writings will find that he will instruct very few
The most powerful means, therefore, of promoting what is good is by example
One man in a thousand can write a book to instruct his neighbors
But every man can be a pattern of living excellence to those around him.'
The work that Christ is doing in believers can result in an influence far greater than any book they might write
Through God's Word, written on their hearts, the Lord is displaying His love and goodness for all to see
As a Christian, you may never write a book, but by living for God you will be one
You will be an open book, an 'epistle of Christ for all to read.
I've always thought that I could get through just about anything if the Lord would tell me what the outcome would be
I believe that all things work together for good in the end, but I'd do a lot better in dark times if I knew exactly what the 'good'
would look like
But God usually doesn't show us where He is taking us
He just asks us to trust Him
It's like driving a car at night
Our headlights never shine all the way to our destination; they illuminate only about 160 feet ahead
But that doesn't deter us from moving forward
We trust our headlights
All we really need is enough light to keep moving forward
God's Word is like headlights in dark times
It is full of promises we need to keep us from driving our lives into the ditch of bitterness and despair
His Word promises that He will never leave us nor forsake us
His Word assures us that He knows the plans He has for us, plans for wholeness and not for evil, to give us 'a future and a hope'
And He tells us that our trials are there to make us better, not bitter
So the next time you feel as if you're driving in the dark, remember to trust your headlights, God's Word will light your way.
Louis Armstrong was well known for his smiling face, raspy voice, white handkerchief, and virtuoso trumpet playing
Yet his childhood was one of want and pain
He was abandoned by his father as an infant and sent to reform school when he was only 12
Surprisingly, this became a positive turning point
Music professor Peter Davis regularly visited the school and provided musical training for the boys
Soon Louis excelled on the cornet and became the leader of the boys' band
His life trajectory seemed to have been reset to become a world-famous trumpet player and entertainer
Louis' story can be an example for Christian parents
The proverb: 'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it'
can apply to more than the spiritual and moral aspects of our children's lives
We should also realize that a child's giftedness will often determine his or her area of interest
In the case of Louis, a little training in music resulted in a virtuoso trumpet player
As we lovingly provide to our children godly instruction from God's Word, we should encourage them in their interests and giftedness so that they might become all that God has planned for them to be.
A tour of the federal prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay left me with some unforgettable images
As our tour boat pulled into the dock, I could see why this now-closed maximum-security federal prison was once known as The Rock
Later, inside the legendary Big House, I stared at shafts of light coming through heavily barred windows
Then I saw row after row of cagelike cells that housed well-known inmates such as Al Capone and Robert Stroud, the 'Birdman of Alcatraz.'
But another image made a deeper impression
Stepping into an empty cell, I saw the name Jesus scrawled on a wall
In another, a Bible lay on a shelf
Together they quietly spoke of the greatest of all freedoms
Paul knew such liberty while waiting to be executed
Regarding himself as a prisoner of Christ, he used his incarceration to help other inmates discover what it means to be an eternally forgiven, dearly loved member of God's family
Barred windows and doors represent one kind of confinement
Physical paralysis, inescapable poverty, and prolonged unemployment are others
Perhaps you endure another
None are to be desired, yet who would trade 'imprisonment' with Christ for life on the outside without Him?
Can we really know whether to label life's circumstances as good or bad
For instance, your car breaks down right before you are to take a family road trip
But when you take the car to the shop, the mechanic says, 'Good thing you didn't take this out on the road
It could have caught fire.
Is that bad because of the inconvenience, or good because of God's protection
Or perhaps your child decides to pursue interests that aren't all that interesting to you
You wanted her to play basketball and run track in high school
But she wanted to sing and play the oboe
You feel frustrated, but she excels and ends up with a music scholarship
Is that bad because your dreams weren't fulfilled, or good because God directed her in ways you could not have predicted
Sometimes it's hard to see how God is working
His mysteries don't always reveal their secrets to us, and our journey is often redirected by uncontrollable detours
Perhaps God is showing us a better route
To make sure we benefit from what might seem bad, we must recognize and trust God's 'unfailing love'
In the end, we'll be able to say, 'I will sing to the Lord, for He has been good to me'
Sometimes people who serve God live with an unstated 'contract faith.'
Because they give time and energy to work for God, they think they deserve special treatment in return
But not my friend Douglas
He has lived a Job-like existence in many ways, experiencing the failure of a ministry, his wife's death from cancer, and injuries from a drunk driver to himself and a child
Yet Douglas advises, Don't confuse God with life
When troubles come and doubts arise, I often turn to Romans 8
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? asked Paul
'Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?'
In that one sentence, Paul summarized his ministry autobiography
He endured trials for the sake of the gospel; yet somehow he had the faith to believe that these things surely not good in themselves, could be used by God to accomplish good
He had learned to see past the hardships to a loving God who will one day prevail
He wrote, I am persuaded that [nothing] shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Confidence like that can go a long way in helping overcome discouragement about how life hasn't worked out the way we thought it would.
Recently I attended a memorial service for a gifted musician whose life had touched many people
The tribute to this Christian woman included video and audio clips, photos, instrumentalists, and speakers
After everyone had left the church, I stopped to thank the technicians whose flawless work at the control board had contributed so much to this moving tribute
No one noticed what you did, I told them
That's the way we like it, they replied
In Matthew 6, Jesus told His disciples to give , pray , and fast in order to please God, not to gain praise from people
When you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place
Whether giving, praying, or fasting, Jesus said, 'Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly'
Something within us makes us want to be seen and recognized for our good deeds
While there's nothing wrong with encouragement and appreciation, a desire for praise can undermine our service because it shifts the focus from others to ourselves
When there is no public thank you, we may feel slighted
But even when we serve God in secret, He sees it all.
I have a dear friend who served as a missionary in Suriname for many years
But in his final years he was stricken with an illness that paralyzed him
At times he wondered why God allowed him to linger
He longed to depart and to be with his Lord
Perhaps life is very hard for you or a loved one, and you are wondering why God has allowed you or your loved one to linger
When Jesus said He was going to heaven, Peter asked, 'Lord, why can I not follow You now?'
You, like Peter, may wonder why entry into heaven has been postponed: 'Why not now?'
God has a wise and loving purpose in leaving us behind
There is work to be done in us that can only be accomplished here on earth
Our afflictions, which are for the moment, are working for us 'a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
And there is work to be done for others, if only to love and to pray
Our presence may also be for the purpose of giving others an opportunity to learn love and compassion
So, though you may desire release for yourself or a loved one, to live on in the flesh can mean fruitfulness
And there is comfort in waiting: Though heaven may be delayed, God has His reasons
No doubt about it!
One of the smartest people I know is a college friend who became a Christian while studying at a state university
He graduated with honors and went on to study at a respected seminary
He served a small church as pastor for several years and then accepted a call to another small church far from family and friends
After 12 years at that church, he sensed that the congregation needed new leadership, so he stepped down
He hadn't been offered a job at a bigger church or a teaching position at a college or seminary
In fact, he didn't even have another job
He just knew that God was leading him in a different direction, so he followed
When we discussed it, my friend said, 'A lot of people talk about being called to something, but I don't hear much about being called from something.'
In many ways, my friend's obedience was like that of Israel's patriarch Abraham, who went out, not knowing where God was leading
Difficulties like famine , fear , and family disputes gave reason for doubt, but Abraham persevered and because of his faith God counted him as righteous
A life of obedience may not be easy, but it will be blessed .
Detective Allan Pinkerton became famous in the mid-1800s by solving a series of train robberies and foiling a plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln as he traveled to his first inauguration
As one of the first agencies of its kind in the US, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency gained even more prominence because of its logo of a wide-open eye with the caption, 'We Never Sleep.'
There is no better feeling than knowing you are protected and secure
You feel peaceful when the doors are locked and all is quiet as you drift off to sleep at night
You feel safe
But many lie awake in their beds with fearful thoughts of the present or dread of the future
Some are afraid of commotion outside or of a spouse who has been violent
Some cannot rest because of worry over a rebellious child
Others are anxiously listening to make sure a seriously ill child is still breathing
These are the times when our loving God encourages us to cry out to Him, to the One who will neither 'slumber nor sleep
Psalm 34:15 reminds us that 'the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry
Pinkerton may have been the original private eye, but the One who really has the eye that never sleeps is listening to the cries of the righteous
After Ffyona Campbell became famous as the first woman to walk around the world, her joy was short-lived
Despite the adulation she received, something troubled her
Guilt overtook her and pushed her to the brink of a nervous breakdown
What was bothering her
I shouldn't be remembered as the first woman to walk around the world, she finally admitted
I cheated
During her worldwide trek, she broke the guidelines of the Guinness Book of World Records by riding in a truck part of the way
To clear her conscience, she called her sponsor and confessed her deception
God has given each of us a conscience that brings guilt when we do wrong
In Romans, Paul describes our conscience as 'accusing or else excusing [us]
For the obedient follower of Christ, care of the conscience is an important way of maintaining a moral compass despite moral imperfection
Confessing sin, turning from it, and making restitution should be a way of life
Paul modeled a well-maintained conscience, saying, I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man
Through confession and repentance, he kept short accounts with God
Is sin bothering you
Follow Paul's example
Strive for a clear conscience.
I read these words on a young woman's personal Web site: 'I just want to be loved, and he has to be amazing!'
Isn't that what we all want, to be loved, to feel cared for by someone
And so much the better if he or she is amazing
The one who fits that description most fully is Jesus Christ
In a display of unprecedented love, He left His Father in heaven and came to earth as the baby we celebrate at Christmas
Then, after living a perfect life, He gave His life as an offering to God on the cross in our behalf
He took our place because we needed to be rescued from our sin and its death penalty
'While we were still sinners, Christ died for us'
Then 3 days later, the Father raised Jesus to life again
When we repent and receive Jesus' gift of amazing love, He becomes our Savior, Lord , Teacher, and Friend
Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!
Looking for someone to love you
Jesus loves us so much more than anyone else possibly could
And He is truly amazing!
Norena's South Florida home was severely damaged during Hurricane Andrew in 1992
She received an insurance settlement, and the repair work began
But the contractors left when the money ran out, leaving an unfinished home with no electricity
For 15 years, Norena got by with a tiny refrigerator and a few lamps connected to extension cords
Surprisingly, her neighbors didn't seem to notice her dilemma
Then, acting on a tip, the mayor got involved and contacted an electrical contractor who restored power to her house within a few hours
When Jesus encountered the Samaritan woman at the well , He got involved in her life and talked to her about her need for spiritual power
He established common ground with her and piqued her spiritual interest and curiosity
He was gracious and sensitive as He confronted her sin and kept the conversation centered on the main issue
Then He confronted her directly with who He was as Messiah
As a result, she and many other Samaritans believed in Him
Let's get involved in the lives of others and tell them about Jesus
He is the only source of spiritual power and satisfies our deepest longings.
The lounging lions in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve looked harmless
They rolled on their backs in low-lying bushes, rubbed their faces on branches as if trying to comb their magnificent manes
They drank leisurely from a stream
They strode slowly across dry, scrubby terrain as if they had all the time in the world
The only time I saw their teeth was when one of them yawned
Their serene appearance is deceiving, however
The reason they can be so relaxed is that they have nothing to fear, no shortage of food and no natural predators
The lions look lazy and listless, but they are the strongest and fiercest of all
One roar sends all other animals running for their lives
Sometimes it seems as if God is lounging
When we don't see Him at work, we conclude that He's not doing anything
We hear people mock God and deny His existence, and we anxiously wonder why He doesn't defend Himself
But God will not be afraid of their voice nor be disturbed by their noise
He has nothing to fear
One roar from Him, and His detractors will scatter like rodents
If you wonder why God isn't anxious when you are, it's because He has everything under control
He knows that Jesus, the Lion of Judah, will triumph.
In a brief biography of St Francis of Assisi, GK Chesterton begins with a glimpse into the heart of this unique and compassionate man born in the 12th century
Chesterton writes: 'As St Francis did not love humanity but men, so he did not love Christianity but Christ
The reader cannot even begin to see the sense of a story that may well seem to him a very wild one, until he understands that to this great mystic his religion was not a thing like a theory but a thing like a love-affair.'
When Jesus was asked to name the greatest command in the Law, He replied, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind
This is the first and great commandment
The questioner wanted to test Jesus, but the Lord answered him with the key element in pleasing God
First and foremost, our relationship with Him is a matter of the heart
If we see God as a taskmaster and consider obedience to Him as a burden, then we have joined those of whom the Lord said, 'I have this against you, that you have left your first love'
The way of joy is to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind.
Few things disable new workers on a job like criticism from veterans
Good hiring managers know to protect new employees by surrounding them with mentors willing to shield them from unnecessary barbs
Hannah is a mentor to us in dealing with criticism and deep desires of the heart
Surrounded by a husband who didn't understand, a taunting peer, and an overly judgmental clergyman, Hannah found a way through the fog by confiding in God
While we now know God answered the prayer of Hannah's heart by giving her a child, we don't know for sure if Eli's blessing was a wish or a promise from God
I think her no-longer-sad face came most of all because she gained peace from confiding in Him
We were created to be in relationship with God; and when we take that relationship to an intimate level, it bonds us not only to His presence but also to His strength
Prayers that express our hurts and emotions are most assuredly welcomed by God because they demonstrate our trust in Him
We will often find perspective, and nearly always come away comforted, knowing we've entrusted the things that are troubling us, whether criticism or deep desires, to the One who is best able to sort through them.
Does it surprise you that trouble is a part of life
Probably not
We all know trouble close-up and personal, bad health, empty bank account, blighted love, grief, loss of job, and the list goes on
It shouldn't surprise us, therefore, that God permits the added trials of being ridiculed and hated because we follow Christ
But trouble, whether it is common to man or unique to Christians, can reveal to us the moral fiber of our soul
I have never seen a golf course without hazards
They are part of the game
Golfers speak of the courses with the most hazards as the most challenging, and they will travel a long way to test their skill against the most demanding 18 holes
Oliver Wendell Holmes said, If I had a formula for bypassing trouble, I wouldn't pass it around
I wouldn't be doing anyone a favor
Trouble creates a capacity to handle it
Meet it as a friend, for you'll see a lot of it and you had better be on speaking terms with it
Let's not think it strange when trouble comes, for God is using it to test the stamina of our souls
The best way to handle trouble is to commit our souls, in doing good, as to a faithful Creator
A hotel in Singapore introduced an express buffet eat all you can in 30 minutes and pay just half the price
After that experience, one diner reported: 'I lost my decorum, stuffing my mouth with yet more food
and I lost my appetite for the rest of the day, so severe was my heartburn.'
Sometimes I think in our devotional reading we treat God's Word like an express buffet
We wolf it down as fast as we can and wonder why we haven't learned very much
Like physical food, spiritual food needs chewing
For those of us who have been Christians for a long time, we may have a tendency to speed-read through the passages we've read many times before
But in doing so, we miss what God is meaning to show us
One sure sign of this is when we learn nothing new from that passage
David's desire was right when he wrote in Psalm 119:15, 'I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways.'
That's the way to treat God's Word, to take time to mull it over
Let's not come to the Bible as if we were going to an express buffet
Only by meditating on God's Word will we get the most value for our spiritual well-being.
I've always thought that you can see the hand of God best in the rearview mirror
Looking back, it's easier to understand why He placed us in the home that He did; why He brought certain people and circumstances into and out of our lives; why He permitted difficulties and pain; why He took us to different places and put us in various jobs and careers
In my own life, I get a lot of clarity about the wise and loving ways of God as I reflect on the ways He has managed my journey by 'the works of [His] hands'
With the psalmist, it makes me glad and strikes a note of joy in my heart to see how often God has assisted, directed, and managed the outcomes so faithfully
Looking ahead, though, is not always so clear
Have you ever had that lost feeling when the road ahead seems twisted, foggy, and scary
Before you move into next year, stop and look in the rearview mirror of the year gone by, and joyfully realize that God meant it when He said, I will never leave you nor forsake you
So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper
I will not fear
With the promise of God's presence and help in mind, you can move ahead into 2011 with utmost confidence.
In a letter to his son Eduard, Albert Einstein gave this advice: 'Life is like riding a bicycle
To keep your balance you must keep moving.'
The great physicist's advice is wise and practical
This wise counsel can apply to the Christian life
Many believers by faith keep moving ahead through painful and trying circumstances
But when they experience a personal moral failure, they lose their balance and fall
Their regret and feeling of unworthiness of God's forgiveness may then keep them down and they no longer move ahead in their spiritual life
The Bible gives us many examples of those who have experienced serious personal failure
Abraham lied to Pharaoh about his wife, Sarah
Jacob deceived his father to acquire Esau's blessing
Moses disobeyed God by striking the rock instead of speaking to it
Despite their failures, we are told: 'all these
obtained a good testimony through faith'
These biblical characters are lifted up as examples because after they fell, they turned back to God and began to follow Him again
Have you lost your spiritual balance through a sinful choice, which is keeping you down
Repent and follow the God of second chances once again.
In the frenzied early days of the Internet, Web developers were making up their own rules
The result was confusion
Among the problems was that what looked good on one computer was unreadable on another
This caused developers to refer to the Internet as the wild, wild Web, an allusion to the days of the wild, wild West in the US when law and order were pretty much nonexistent
To bring order out of chaos, Web developers started calling for others to agree on common standards
Their plea reminds us of why it was important for the Israelites to have laws to live by when they left Egypt
Without them, there would be anarchy
With them, however, they would have a system that was so superior that it would demonstrate to other nations the greatness of their God
Today, to bring order out of the chaos of our sinful, selfish world, believers submit to the law of Christ , who Himself is the fulfillment of the law
When we submit to the standard established by Christ and love others as God loves us, we will live in peace with one another and thus provide a witness to the world of how great God is.
During the last week of December, newscasters often look back at the significant events of the past year, the triumphs and failures of prominent people, natural disasters, economic challenges, and the deaths of celebrities and leaders
The most surprising events usually receive top billing
If you reviewed the past year of your life, what would appear on the list
Has an unexpected event caused you to question God or to more deeply experience His goodness
Psalm 77 chronicles the lament of a person in distress who felt as if God no longer cared
'Has His mercy ceased forever
Has His promise failed forevermore?'
Yet, even in anguish, the psalmist said, 'I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember Your wonders of old'
The result was a renewal of trust and hope: 'You are the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the peoples'
As you think back over this past year, why not write down the significant events in your life
Don't be afraid to include your difficulties and disappointments, but remember to consider all the ways God has been with you
During every difficulty, we can always find the faithfulness of God.
Did you hear about the church that didn't have enough room for parking
Fortunately, it was located right next to a store that was closed on Sundays, so a church member asked the store owner if they could overflow into his parking lot
No problem, he said, You can use it 51 weeks out of the year, on the 52nd week, though, it will be chained off
The man was grateful, but asked curiously, What happens that week
The store owner smiled, Nothing
I just want you to remember that it's not your parking lot
It's easy to take for granted all the material and spiritual blessings that God has given us
That's why we need to stop and remember that Scripture says the true owner of all we possess is God: 'All that is in heaven and in earth is Yours
Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and You are exalted as head over all
Even our bodies do not belong to us: 'Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
and you are not your own
For you were bought at a price
As 1 Timothy 6:17 reminds us: God gives us richly all things to enjoy
We are so abundantly blessed with good things
Let's never take our Father for granted, but use wisely and gratefully all that He has given us.
As my wife reviewed her day, she told me about an incident that took place with our granddaughter Eliana, who was visiting
Eliana had been playing with some toys, so when she wanted to go to another part of the house, Grandma told her, Eliana, you need to put your toys away first
Without missing a beat, Eliana replied, I don't have time
She was just 2 years old at the time, so she was definitely not running on a packed schedule
I wonder sometimes if God might be a bit surprised with us when He hears our responses to His commands
For instance, when Jesus says, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden and we say, I can't go on
I have too many troubles and problems, I wonder what He thinks
When He says, Be still, and know that I am God, and we say, I can't fit You into my schedule, I wonder what He thinks
When He says, Be holy, for I am holy, and we say, But the world looks like so much fun, I wonder what He thinks
God has spoken
Obedience is the best way to honor Him for what He has done for us and to show Him how much we love Him.
The Christmas story, recorded in Matthew and Luke, has become so familiar that I wonder if we grasp the reality of what actually happened: An angel told a young virgin that she would conceive a child by the power of the Holy Spirit
The angel then told her fiancé to marry her and name the baby Jesus, 'for He will save His people from their sins'
Shepherds saw angels in the sky and were told of a Savior's birth in Bethlehem
Wise men traveled hundreds of miles to worship the One who, they said, 'has been born King of the Jews'
Amazing
Equally astonishing is that Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise men did exactly as they had been told
Mary yielded herself to God; Joseph took her home as his wife; the shepherds went to Bethlehem to find the baby in a manger; and the wise men followed the star
With no idea of the outcome, they all took the next step by faith in the Lord
Amazing
How is it with us this Christmas
Will we trust God and follow His leading even when we face uncertainty and overwhelming circumstances
When you and I obey the Lord, the outcome is truly amazing!
I wouldn't want to pick a fight with a sky full of angels, but I must admit that I've always wondered about the promise of peace the angelic host made to the shepherds in the fields outside Bethlehem
For the last 2,000 years, peace on our planet has been at best a rare commodity
Wars continue to ravage innocent lives, domestic violence is a growing calamity, divorce rates soar, churches split, and peace in our restless and wayward hearts seems to be an elusive dream
Where is the promised peace
Actually, on reflection, we can see that Jesus brought all that is needed for peace in our world
He taught the principles of peace, calling for people to love their neighbors as they love themselves
And as He was leaving this planet, He promised, 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you'
He told us to turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, forgive offenses, reject greed, tolerate each other's weaknesses, live to serve and love one another as He has loved us
It seems that in large part, peace is up to us
In Isaiah's words, 'We have turned, every one, to his own way'
God's solution to our waywardness was unimaginable: The Artist paid the price to recreate what we ruined
One day, there will be another opening ceremony, and everyone in heaven and on earth will bow at the name of Jesus
And those from every nation who have accepted God's plan in Christ will worship together in the flawless New Jerusalem .
The Puritans wisely sought to connect all of life to its source in God, bringing the two worlds together rather than dividing them into sacred and secular
They had a saying, 'God loveth adverbs; and careth not how good, but how well.'
Adverbs describe verbs our words of action and activity
The proverb implies that God cares more about the spirit in which we live than the concrete results

Pleasing God doesn't mean that we must busy ourselves with a new set of 'spiritual' activities
As the Puritans said, whether cleaning house or preaching sermons, shoeing horses or translating the Bible, any human activity may constitute an offering to God
We spend much time immersed in the mundane
'But we have the mind of Christ,' Paul reminds us
That truth is to guide everything we do
Caring for an elderly parent
Cleaning up after a child
Sitting on a porch with a neighbor
Fielding a customer's complaint
Filling out patient charts at a nurses' station
Sitting in traffic
Sawing lumber
Reporting tips
Shopping for groceries
We need faith and the mind of the Lord Jesus to recognize something of lasting value in even our most ordinary tasks.
Mark your calendar now if you want to see the next celestial convergence of Venus, Jupiter, and the moon
On November 18, 2052, you'll be able to peer through the evening darkness as those solar system neighbors 'gather' in a tiny area of the sky
That remarkable juxtaposition of reflective spheres last sparkled the night sky on December 1, 2008, and it will happen again 4 decades from now
This predictability, as well as things such as eclipses and the return of Halley's Comet , prove the orderliness of the universe
If no fixed set of laws governed the movement of everything in the universe, such predictions could not be made
Are these set rules more than random standards
Can we see God's hand in these celestial certainties
Look at Jeremiah 33:25-26
God has in view the covenantal relationship between Himself and His people, and He uses a scientific fact in the analogy
In effect, God says that His fixed universal laws, 'the ordinances of heaven and earth have the same certainty as His promises to His covenant people
God's laws have governed the universe since its creation and continue to do so with astounding predictability
So mark your calendar, and be amazed by God's unchanging control.
Jean-Dominique Bauby's memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, describes his life after a massive stroke left him with a condition called 'Locked-In Syndrome.'
Although he was almost completely paralyzed, Bauby was able to write his book by blinking his left eyelid
An aide would recite a coded alphabet, until Bauby blinked to choose the letter of a word he was dictating
The book required about 200,000 blinks to write
Bauby used the only physical ability left him to communicate with others
In 2 Timothy we read of Paul experiencing a different kind of 'locked-in syndrome.'
Under house arrest, the apostle learned that his execution might be imminent
With this in view, he told Timothy: 'I suffer trouble even to the point of chains; but the Word of God is not chained'
In spite of his isolation, Paul welcomed visitors, wrote letters of encouragement, and rejoiced at the spread of God's Word
For some of us, circumstances may have isolated us from others
Lying in a hospital bed, serving time in a prison, or being a shut-in can make us feel that we are experiencing our own 'locked-in syndrome.'
If this is true for you, why not prayerfully reflect on some ways you can still reach out to others.
Imagine going to work one day and being greeted by your boss, who says, 'Come by my office at 9:30
I'd like to talk to you about how you're doing on the job.'
This could be a nervous time for you as you think about what your supervisor might say
You wonder, How does my boss think I've been doing
Could there be a promotion with a pay increase
Or could I lose my job
Am I going to hear, 'Well done' or 'You're done'?
As important as this kind of meeting is, the Bible speaks of another, far more significant review
After this life is past, we will stand before our Lord
Paul wrote, 'For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad'
We will not enter that future evaluation fearful of losing our salvation, nor will we desire personal benefit or human approval
Instead, we will be eager to hear the Master say, 'Well done, good and faithful servant'
The challenge before us as followers of Christ is to serve Him with excellence now so that we can hear His words, 'Well done' then
Based on the way I am living today, what kind of review will I get when I see the Savior?
A missionary and I were invited to lunch with David, a man in his late seventies who generously supported the missionary's ministry
David was not able to visit the missionary's country
but as he gave thanks for the food, he prayed with complete ease for the people, places, and situations there
David had a perspective on missions that extended beyond his own country of Singapore
Our Lord Jesus commanded us to have a worldwide perspective on missions
When He said, 'Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you'
He was not asking us to buy an around-the-world ticket to do His bidding
We may not have the opportunity to travel much beyond our own birthplace, 
but we can be involved with what's going on in the world without leaving our hometown
But how
Is there an international student living near you
A family from another country who is trying to cope with life in a new country
Or just a lonely person whom you can cheer up
Sharing Jesus' love with them is your way of crossing the oceans with the gospel.
The highway that winds around the southern shore of Lake Michigan can be treacherous in the winter
One weekend as we were driving back to Grand Rapids from Chicago, a buildup of snow and ice slowed traffic, caused numerous accidents, and almost doubled our drive time
We were relieved as we eased off the expressway onto our final road
It was then that my husband said out loud, 'Thanks, Lord
I think I can take it from here.
Just as he finished saying the words, our car spun around 180 degrees
As we came to a stop, hearts pounding
we could just imagine God saying: 'Are you sure?'
Why do we sometimes try to go it alone in life when at every moment we have access to God
He said: 'I am with you and will keep you wherever you go'
And He assures us: 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'
Scottish mathematician, theologian, and preacher Thomas Chalmers wrote: 'When I walk by the wayside, He is along with me
When I enter into company, amid all my forgetfulness of Him, He never forgets me
Go where I will, He tends me, and watches me, and cares for me.
What a comfort to know that God is always with us we don't need to go through life alone!
On January 1, 2008, Keith Severin and his 7-year-old son, Adrien, agreed that they would spend at least 15 minutes every day that year searching together for treasure
Carlos Alcala's article in the Sacramento Bee described how they went out each day in every kind of weather to see what they could find
A year later their collection of coins, golf balls, recyclable bottles and cans, and various other items had yielded more than $1,000
In the process, they enjoyed many hours of companionship and fun
If we decided to spend 15 minutes a day searching for treasure in the Bible, what would we find
Solomon wrote: 'If you seek [wisdom] as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures; then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God
Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path'
Growth won't happen all at once
But gradually, day by day, we will be changed through reading God's Word and obeying Him
And think of the privilege and pleasure of spending time with our heavenly Father
It begins with a willing commitment, continues with exciting discoveries, and leads to the treasure of wisdom and life.
Longtime California pastor Ray Stedman once told his congregation: 'On New Year's Eve we realize more than at any other time in our lives that we can never go back in time
We can look back and remember, but we cannot retrace a single moment of the year that is past.'
Stedman then referred to the Israelites as they stood on the edge of a new opportunity
After four decades of desert wanderings by their people, this new generation may have wondered if they had the faith and fortitude to possess the Promised Land
Their leader, Moses, reminded them that they had seen 'every great act of the Lord which He did' and that their destination was 'a land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year'
On New Year's Eve, we may fear the future because of events in the past
But we need not remain chained to our old memories because we can move ahead focused on God
Just as the Lord watched over the land and His people, so His eyes will be upon us
God's faithful care will extend to every day of the new year
We can count on that promise.
The former athlete had neglected his body for too long, so he began an exercise routine
The first day, he did several push-ups and went for a light jog
The next day, more push-ups, a few sit-ups, and a longer run
Day 3: exercises and a mile-and-a-half run
On Day 4, our ex-athlete in re-training woke up with a sore throat
Then he did one more exercise: He jumped to the conclusion that exercising was a bad idea
If all he got out of his huffing and puffing was sickness, it wasn't for him
Let's examine another scenario
A Christian, realizing he has neglected his relationship with God, begins a new spiritual routine of Bible-reading and prayer
But after just a few days, some problems arise in his life
What does he conclude
Like the ex-athlete, should he decide that his spiritual quest was a bad idea and that it didn't do any good
Certainly not
We don't pray and read the Bible to get a perfect, trouble-free life
Pursuing God is not cause and effect
We do it because it draws us closer in our relationship with the One who is perfect
The pursuit of godliness will not exempt us from trouble
But a life dedicated to loving and pursuing God is always a good idea no matter what happens.
Alyssa, who is 6 and just learning to read, often saw her parents and grandparents reading their Bibles in the morning
Early one day, she woke up before everyone else
Grandma found her sitting on the couch, with her Bible and a devotional booklet on her lap
She wanted to follow the example of spending time with God at the beginning of the day
Timothy, a young pastor, faced heavy responsibilities in the church at Ephesus
training believers, leading in worship, countering false doctrine
The older, experienced apostle Paul gave him instruction on leading the church in these areas
but he also mentioned the importance of personal conduct
He said, 'Be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity'
Paul challenged Timothy: 'Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine'
If he paid attention to his own spiritual life and to solid doctrine, he would be a godly example to the church family
We all have others who are observing us
Even little Alyssa has younger siblings watching her
Let's live our lives in such a way that those who follow our example will help others in their walk with God.
Along the old Oregon Trail in Idaho there is a marker a giant lava boulder known locally as Register Rock
It's located in an area which was one of the favorite overnight camping areas for westbound immigrants who traveled the trail in the 19th century
Travelers often inscribed their names on the rock as a memorial to their passage
Register Rock stands as a monument to their courage and tenacity
When I think of Register Rock, I think of other pilgrims who have passed by us on their journey
Hebrews 11 lists some of those hardy souls Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel, to name a few
But there are other more recent pilgrims: my mother and father, my fifth-grade Sunday school teacher Mrs Lincoln, my youth leader John Richards, my mentors Ray Stedman and Howard Hendricks, and a host of others I could name
They may not have inscribed their names on rocks, but they're written in my memory
The author of Hebrews reminds us to remember 'pilgrims' who have gone before us, especially those 'who have spoken the Word of God' to us and to consider 'the outcome of their conduct'
And, most important, he encourages us to follow their faith.
Has God ever asked you to do something that seemed unreasonable
Something that took you into the territory of the unknown
What if He asked you to refuse a long-awaited promotion or resist a longed-for relationship
What if He called you to a remote part of the world or asked you to release your children to serve Him in a faraway place
The unknown is full of haunting 'what ifs.'
Yet God often calls us to chart unknown territory as we follow Him
Obeying His commands to forgive, to give away our treasures, or to give up things that provide security and pleasure often leave us in the scary territory of unknown outcomes
Imagine how Abraham felt when God asked him to move his whole family without telling him where they were going
God also asked Abraham to persevere to stay in an unknown land even when the lure of past comforts may have threatened to seduce him and his family back to their comfort zone in Ur
Entering a new year is like entering uncharted territory
The fear of the unknown could cripple our capacity to follow God's leading through the days ahead
Yet, like Abraham, when we cling to the One who knows all things, we're in good hands regardless of where He leads.
Some words used to describe the opening ceremony of the 2008 summer Olympics were awesome, breathtaking, and extravagant
One commentator observed, 'This shows what happens when you give an artist an unlimited budget.'
When I heard this, I thought, That's what God did at creation
He held nothing back
The resulting universe is stunning in beauty, staggering in complexity, extravagant in all regards
The Olympic ceremony was perfect in its precision; but if just one drummer or dancer had decided to alter the artist's vision, the whole ceremony would have been flawed
That's what happened shortly after creation
Unlike the Olympic producer, God allowed free choice, and His work of art was marred by Adam and Eve's idea of a better way
In 1955, when the South was still highly segregated, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, visited relatives in Mississippi
After Emmett 'dared' to talk to a white woman, two white men brutally murdered him
An all-white, male jury found the two 'not guilty' after deliberating for barely an hour
The two men later confessed to the crime in a Life magazine article
Following the verdict, Emmett's mother said, 'Two months ago I had a nice apartment in Chicago
I had a good job
I had a son
When something happened to Negroes in the South, I said, '\sThat's their business, not mine.' 
Now I know how wrong I was
The murder of my son has shown me that what happens to any of us, anywhere in the world, had better be the business of us all.'
Making another's concerns our own is what Leviticus 19:18 calls us to do: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
Jesus quotes this verse and interprets it as not placing any limitations on loving those around us
Our neighbor doesn't just mean someone close by; it's anyone who has a need
We are to care for others as we care for ourselves
To love our neighbor means to make the persecution, suffering, and injustice of our fellow human beings our own
It is the business of all who follow Christ.
In Psalm 139, David describes God as fashioning his tiny body together in the darkness of his mother's womb
God loved David before he ever existed
God designed the person David was to be, and He brought that person into being according to His predetermined plan
In this psalm, David used the intriguing metaphor of a journal in which God first wrote His plan and then brought that plan into fruition through His handiwork in the womb
Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed And in Your book they all were written
Put another way, David was shaped by his heavenly Father's love into a unique creation
He came from the inventive heart and hand of God
What was true of David is true of you
You are special along with everyone else in the world
This being true, we must be pro-life in the purest sense of the word
We are to respect and cherish all human life: the born and those still in the womb; winsome children and weary seniors; the wealthy executive and the financially destitute
All persons are unique productions of our Creator's genius
With David, let's exclaim: 'I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made'
Barbara Mertz has a complaint about Egypt's Pharaoh Ramses II
In her book Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs, archaeologist Mertz writes, 'One gets so tired of Ramses; his face, his figure, and/or his name are plastered over half the wall surfaces still standing in Egypt at least it seems that way.'
Insatiably thirsty for glory, Ramses reveled in Egyptian religion, which taught that the pharaoh was divine
Contrast Ramses' desire for glory with the attitude of Paul and Barnabas
On one of their missionary journeys, they faced a situation during which they refused to accept vainglory
When a crowd in the idolatrous city of Lystra saw them heal a crippled man, the people exclaimed, 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'
They immediately prepared animals to sacrifice in honor of Paul and Barnabas
But the two quickly objected, saying, 'We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God'
We do not rival the apostles in our accomplishments for God, but we all have things we do for Him
It's then that we must be 'glory deflectors,' making sure God gets all the glory for everything we have done.
A year ago today, 155 people on US Airways Flight 1549 thought they were going to die
During take-off from New York City, their plane struck a flock of geese, disabling both engines
In a powerless glide, the captain maneuvered over the densely populated area, then announced: 
Brace for impact
Less than 90 seconds later, the crippled plane made a water landing in the frigid Hudson River, where boats and ferries quickly arrived to rescue the passengers and crew, all of whom survived
People called it the 'miracle on the Hudson' and praised the pilot and crew
One grateful passenger said simply, 'We have a second chance in life.'
In times of crisis, we grasp the importance of every hour
During our ordinary routine, however, we often forget that each day is a second chance
'Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not 
They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness
'\sThe Lord is my portion,' says my soul, 'therefore I hope in Him!'
We can choose to live with thankfulness for God's mercy and grace, with confidence in His faithful care, and with hope because He is with us forever
Today, God offers us a second chance in life
Let's make the most of it!
For hundreds of years, windmills around the world have been used to pump water and to process grains
But in the last few decades, as wind turbines producing electricity have become more prevalent, a 'fly in the ointment' unexpectedly occurred
Researchers discovered that windpower generators worked fine at slow speeds
but at high-wind velocity, bugs on the blades reduced power output
Operators found that it was necessary to regularly wash off the buildup of dead insects to avoid having them slowly decrease the turbine's power
A buildup of sin in a Christian's life can be a problem as well
God has provided a way to clear the accumulation of sins from our lives
First John 1:9 reminds us: 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.'
But unless we do that often, we'll be running on diminished power
That's because the power for living comes from God and not us
When we try to live the Christian life in our own strength, we'll feel defeated, like windmills robbed of their energy
God's power can be more easily seen and experienced in our lives when we get rid of sin's buildup every day.
The recent global financial crisis caused people to pay closer attention to their credit report
When credit was easy to get, some people became careless about how they used it
They didn't bother to save for what they wanted; they just borrowed
Being in debt was no big deal
But in a crisis, that is no longer the case
Having good credit is suddenly very important
After an advertisement for a credit repair service, a local newscaster said, 'Credit repair isn't something you can buy; it's something you have to work for.'
The same principle applies to the credibility of our lives
We can't buy it; it's something we have to work for
We may be able to 'borrow' credibility for a while by associating ourselves with credible people
but sooner or later we will need our own
Credibility has to do with the ability to elicit belief
The reason it's essential for Christians is that our lives affect God's reputation
When we call ourselves by Christ's name, His reputation is tied to ours
If people have reason not to believe us, they may not believe God
The way to earn credibility is to live honorably
Then others will believe and glorify God.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of becoming a black belt in karate
Several years ago, I began training and came close to fulfilling that goal
However, two belts away from my goal, I quit
There were two reasons my teacher changed styles in the middle of my training, and I got so busy that I could not devote adequate time for training
Almost every week, I am nagged by the thought that God wants me to be a finisher in all aspects of my life but especially in my service for Him
As Paul spoke of the conclusion of his life, he did not have any nagging thoughts of unfinished business about his ministry
In this final farewell , Paul used imagery-rich words to talk about finishing his service for Christ
He described his life and ministry in terms of a fight: 'I have fought the good fight.'
The fight was good because he had engaged in it for God and the gospel
Then he used the imagery of a race as synonymous with his ministry: 'I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.'
Paul affirmed that by God's grace he had finished all that God had given him to do
As followers of Jesus, let us strive to be finishers, persevering in our service for Jesus Christ.
He knew that day where he would spend eternity
Realizing that we are sinners and placing our trust in Jesus' death and resurrection assures us that we can immediately know where we will spend our eternal tomorrows when we slip behind the parted curtain.
Spiridon Louis isn't well known around the world, but he is in Greece
That's because of what happened in 1896 when the Olympic Games were revived in Athens
During the competition that year, the Greeks did quite well winning the most medals of any nation
But the event that became a source of true Greek pride was the first-ever marathon
Seventeen athletes competed in this race of 40 kilometers , but it was won by Louis a common laborer
For his efforts, Louis was honored by king and country, and he became a national hero
The apostle Paul used running a race as a picture of the Christian life
In 1 Corinthians 9:24, he challenged us not just to run but to run to win
He said 'Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize
Run in such a way that you may obtain it.'
Not only did Paul teach this but he lived it out
In his final epistle, he said, 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
Having finished his race, Paul joyfully anticipated receiving the victory crown from the King of heaven
Like Paul, run your earthly race to win and to please your King.
The word connected captures our contemporary experience of life
Many people rarely go anywhere without a cell phone, iPod, laptop, or pager
We have become accessible 24 hours a day
Some psychologists see this craving to stay connected as an addiction
Yet a growing number of people are deliberately limiting their use of technology
Being a 'tech-no' is their way of preserving times of quiet, while limiting the flow of information into their lives
Many followers of Christ find that a daily time of Bible reading and prayer is essential in their walk of faith
This 'quiet time' is a disconnection from external distractions in order to connect with God
The 'green pastures' and 'still waters' of Psalm 23:2 are more than an idyllic country scene
They speak of our communion with God whereby He restores our souls and leads us in His paths
All of us can make time to meet with God, but do we
In Robert Foster's booklet '7 Minutes With God,' he suggests a way to begin
Start with a brief prayer for guidance, then read the Bible for a few minutes, and close with a short time of prayer that includes adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication for others
It's vital to take time today to connect with the Lord, who is our life.
William Adams is believed to be the first Englishman to reach Japan
Taking a liking to Adams, the ruling Japanese shogun made him his interpreter and personal advisor concerning the Western powers
Eventually, Adams was presented with two swords with rank of a Samurai
This showed just how much the Japanese revered Adams
Because William Adams served his foreign king well, he was also rewarded with greater opportunity for influence
Centuries earlier, another man in a foreign country also had great influence over his king
Nehemiah was a cupbearer to Persian King Artaxerxes
In the royal court, the cupbearer would test the wine before it was given to the king
to protect him from poisoning
But this position also meant he had the king's ear as a trusted advisor
Nehemiah's integrity, administrative gifts, and wisdom made him a confidant to his ruler, which paved the way for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem
Like Nehemiah, each of us has been given a unique sphere of influence
Raising children, church or community work, and employment all provide a platform where we can have a beneficial effect on others
Has the Lord placed someone in your life upon whom you can have an influence?
As a child, I learned to behave properly when adults rewarded my good behavior and punished my bad behavior
This worked pretty well because the reward or punishment generally came quickly after the behavior
making the relationship between the cause and effect unmistakable
When I became an adult, however, life got more complex, and the consequences of my actions were not always immediate
When I behaved badly without getting in trouble for it, I began to think that it didn't matter to God what I did
Something similar happened to the children of Israel
When they disobeyed God and didn't suffer any bad consequences right away, they said, 'The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see!'
, indicating their belief that God had lost interest in them and didn't care about their bad behavior
But they were wrong
Weary of their waywardness, God finally said, 'None of My words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled'
When God delays discipline, it's not due to indifference; it's due to His very nature
He is gracious and slow to anger
Some see that as permission to sin, but God intends it to be an invitation to repent .
You may be familiar with the list of seven deadly sins that was formulated during the sixth century: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, vengeance, envy, and pride
But you may not know that the original list compiled during the fourth century also included the sin of sadness
Over the years, that emotion was omitted from the inventory
Some people are blessed with a cheerful disposition
They always seem to be happy
They wear a perpetual smile almost as if they were advertising toothpaste
But then there are others who seem to be chronically sad
They continually complain about life and its burdens
And who can deny that afflictions are discouraging
While we acknowledge that not everybody is blessed with a bright outlook on life, we need to remember that joy is one of the gifts Jesus promised to His followers
And we need to resist any tendency to let sadness dominate our emotional lives
Jesus promised His disciples on the night Judas betrayed Him, 'Your joy no one will take from you'
Remember that joy is the fruit of the indwelling Holy Spirit
Let's ask the Lord to help us look beyond our sorrowful circumstances and encourage our hearts by the vision of joy that awaits us .
When a teenager named Poh Fang learned about Jesus' love for her and received Him as her Savior, her parents weren't sure about the merits of Christianity
So they sent her older sister with her to church to keep an eye on her
But something happened that they didn't expect
The powerful Word of God penetrated the heart of the older sister, and she accepted Jesus as her Savior as well
The psalmist said of the Word of God, 'Your precepts have given me life'
That's the testimony of Poh Fang and her sister and of all who know Christ as Savior
His Word is 'powerful and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart'
God's Word shows us our sin and its consequences: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'
the wages of sin is death
It tells us of God's love and salvation: 'God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, made us alive together with Christ '
And it gives wisdom for daily living: 'Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path'
Thank You, Lord, for Your powerful Word, which gives us life and direction for daily living.
Have you ever felt like giving up
Elijah did
The Lord had just used him to show the nation of Israel that the Lord is God
Yet, the threats of Queen Jezebel so alarmed him that he ran to Beersheba, 100 miles south
Then he walked another 150 miles south to Horeb, the mountain of God
Twice God asked Elijah what he was doing there
Both times he answered with identical words I alone am left; and they seek to take my life'
He had become so preoccupied with his own fears that he had forgotten what God had done through him at Mount Carmel
Despite his great victory, Elijah plunged into the depths of discouragement
How easy it is for us to do the same
God did not accept Elijah's notice that he was quitting
Instead, He commissioned his tired servant to handle three major tasks
And by the way, Elijah was wrong when he said he was the only faithful one left
God had 7,000 others who had not bowed to Baal
Perhaps, like Elijah, you are despairing at the circumstances in your life
Let God speak to you
Instead of allowing you to quit, He will show you what you can do through His strength.
It would have been simpler just to buy a new hair dryer
But determined to save a buck, I decided to fix it myself
In order to loosen the screw that was buried deep in the handle, I took out the ultimate handyman's helper my pocket knife
As I put pressure on the knife to turn the screw, the blade folded back on my finger
I learned a lesson that day: I love myself
And I am urgent about meeting my needs
There was no thought of, 'Well, I don't really have time to stop the bleeding now
I'll get to it later.
Also, there was a tenderness about how the need was met
I instructed my first-aid team to wash my finger gently and then to put the bandage on in a way that would avoid having the hairs on my finger pulled up when it was removed
My thoughts, words, and actions were driven by my love for myself
To love 'your neighbor as yourself' requires the same urgent kind of love
It's a love that notices the need of another person and won't rest until it's been met
It's a gentle, tender love that thinks and acts carefully
It's the sacrificial and compassionate love that a nameless Samaritan had for a fallen traveler
It's the kind of love God wants to share with your neighbors through you.
Imagine being a visitor in a foreign land, showing up unannounced at a gathering of people you have never met and who have never heard of you and then being allowed to address that group just a few minutes later
That can happen only if something breaks down barriers something like mutual friends
It happened when I took a missions team to a church service in Discovery Bay, Jamaica
Before we left the US, my friend Dorant Brown, a Jamaican pastor, recommended a church to attend
So when we arrived at the church, and I mentioned Pastor Brown, we were not only welcomed, but I was also asked to speak briefly and our team was asked to sing
While sharing Dorant's name was vital, I really don't think it was that mutual friend who got us such a warm welcome
I think it was our shared Friend and Savior Jesus who opened our Jamaican friends' hearts to our visit
Have you experienced a connection with someone you just met when you tell them you too know Jesus
He's a friend who laid down His life for us , and He makes brothers and sisters of all who believe
Jesus
Our Savior
Our mutual Friend
He joins hearts around the world under the banner of His love.
At the age of 16, pianist Leon Fleisher made his formal debut at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic
He went on to win prestigious international competitions and played in the world's finest concert halls
But at the age of 37, Fleisher was struck with dystonia, a neurological condition that crippled his right hand
After a period of despondency and withdrawal, he turned to teaching and conducting, because, as he said, he loved music more than he loved the piano
When our dreams are shattered, how do we react
After Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, was sold as a slave by his brothers , he could have given in to self-pity and self-indulgence
Instead, Joseph remained true to the Lord
Four times in Genesis 39, we read that 'the Lord was with' Joseph , and his actions revealed his own faithfulness to God
By his exemplary life, those he served in Egypt recognized God's presence with him
Do we love God more than our own dreams
Although Joseph must have grieved the loss of his past and what his life could have been, the Lord led him to a calling he had never imagined
Today, the Lord longs to lead us
Are we willing to be redirected by Him?
Then Jesus told a parable about a man who harvested a bumper crop and began to make plans to increase and enjoy his riches
He concluded, God said to him, Fool This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided
So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God
The trouble with greed is that ultimately our goods go
But worse we go
Better to store up treasure in heaven, invest in spiritual riches, and become 'rich toward God.'
In the normal course of providence, God works in and through creation, not despite it
For this reason, some answers to prayer are difficult to prove with certainty
'Only faith vouches for the connection,' C S Lewis writes
'No empirical proof could establish it.'
We believe a prayer has been answered not because of any scientific criteria proving it, but because we have faith
Most of the ways we encounter God nature, the Bible, the Lord's Supper, the church, other people include things we can touch
God's own state, though, is the realm of spirit
Prayer reflects that difference between us
Although we may ask God to intervene directly, it should not surprise us if He responds in a more hidden way in cooperation with our own choices
An alcoholic prays, 'Lord, keep me from drink today.'
The answer to that prayer will likely come from the inside from a stiffening resolve or a cry for help to a loyal friend rather than from some marvel like the magical disappearance of liquor bottles from a cabinet
Whether God supernaturally intervenes or is giving us the power to obey Him, we trust His character
We see a true partnership, intimate and intertwined.
If there were a contest for most popular virtue, I suspect that 'fast' would beat 'best.'
Many parts of the world seem to be obsessed with speed
The 'fast' craze, however, is getting us nowhere, fast
'The time has come to challenge our obsession with doing everything more quickly,' says Carl Honore in his book In Praise of Slowness
'Speed is not always the best policy.'
According to the Bible, he's right
Peter warned that in the last days people would doubt God because it seems He is slow in fulfilling His promise to return
Peter pointed out, however, that this seeming slowness is a good thing
God is actually demonstrating His patience by giving people more time to repent , and also being true to His character, as in patient or slow to anger
We too must be slow to become angry and slow to speak
According to James, 'quickness' is reserved for our ears
We're supposed to be quick to listen
Think about how much trouble we could avoid if we learned to listen really listen, not just stop talking before we speak
In our rush to meet goals and deadlines, let's remember to speed up our listening and to slow down our tempers and our tongues.
The university where I teach as an adjunct professor provides laptop computers for its students
While this can be an aid to the students in many ways, I have discovered one way it hinders learning: The laptops can become a distraction during class
Because the students take notes on their laptops, they have them open on their desks during class
The problem is that they find texting their friends, visiting Facebook, or checking things on the Internet more interesting than my lectures
A laptop loses value in the learning environment if it becomes a distraction even if what the students are doing is positive
Good things can do that
Things that have value can draw our attention away from what we should be paying attention to
This was true for Martha
Luke 10:40 says she was 'distracted with much serving,'
which took her away from spending time with Jesus
In the same way, a good hobby can have value in and of itself
But if it distracts you from your family responsibilities or relationship with God, some changes are needed
Are life's good options distracting you from what your primary priorities should be
Return, as Jesus told Martha, to what 'is needed.'
The documentary In the Shadow of the Moon includes the story of Charlie Duke, one of the Apollo 16 astronauts launched to the moon in 1972
While the command ship orbited the moon, Duke and another astronaut landed the lunar module Orion on the moon's surface
After 3 days of running experiments and collecting lunar rocks, the Apollo 16 crew safely returned to earth
Later, Charlie had a spiritual transformation
He said it began when his friend invited him to a Bible study
After the meeting, Charlie prayed to Christ, 'I give You my life, and if You're real come into my life.'
He then experienced an indescribable peace
It was so profound that he began to share his story with others
Charlie told them, 'My walk on the moon lasted 3 days and it was a great adventure, but my walk with God lasts forever.'
The Bible tells us of another man who walked with God
'Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him'
His spiritual walk with God was so close that God took him directly into eternity
We can learn a lesson from Charlie and Enoch
For believers, no matter where our journey leads, our walk with God will last for eternity!
In the quietness of my final years I plan to watch a tree grow a birch tree I planted as a tiny sapling over 30 years ago
It stands now in mature splendor, just outside our picture window beautiful in every season of the year
So it is with our spiritual endeavors: We may have planted, watered, and fussed over our 'saplings' for a time, but only God can make a 'tree.'
Occasionally I hear from those I ministered to years ago, and discover to my delight that they have grown to maturity and have been greatly used of God with no help from me
It's a gentle reminder that I plant and water for a while, and help others 'grow up in all things into Him who is the head Christ'
But only God 'gives the increase'
German theologian Helmut Thielicke writes, 'The man who doesn't know how to let go, who is a stranger to quiet, confident joy in Him who carries out His purposes without us , in Him who makes the trees grow
that man will become nothing but a miserable creature in his old age.'
So, at my age, I may yet tend a sapling or two, but mostly I will let go and watch them grow.
On a trip through Chicago, I saw a poster advertising a business management seminar
The poster's message was intriguing: The Value of a Leader Is Directly Proportional to That Leader's Values
The accuracy of that statement struck me
What we value shapes our character and will ultimately define how we lead, or whether we can lead at all
This does not apply only to leaders, however
For the follower of Christ, values are even more significant
When Paul wrote to the believers at Colosse, he said, 'Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth'
His point is that only as we allow our values to be motivated and shaped by the eternal will we be effective ambassadors of Christ in the world
It is in the understanding that we are pilgrims in this world, not tourists
that we can keep a clear perspective and an undistracted heart and can more effectively serve the Savior
It has been said that we live in a world that knows the cost of everything but the value of nothing
In this world of the 'here and now,' however, followers of Christ are called to build our values around what lasts forever
To say it another way: The Effectiveness of a Believer Is Directly Proportional to That Believer's Values.
A man who has been my mentor and friend for many years often says that his goal in studying the Bible is always personal application
I appreciate his emphasis on putting learning into practice, because it's too easy for those of us who study, discuss, teach, and write about the Bible to take a merely intellectual approach to the Word
Oswald Chambers said: 'There is a danger with the children of God of getting too familiar with sublime things
We talk so much about these wonderful realities, and forget that we have to exhibit them in our lives
It is perilously possible to mistake the exposition of the truth for the truth; to run away with the idea that because we are able to expound these things, we are living them too.'
James reminds us that the person 'who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does'
The key issue is not what is preached or written, but what is done
When I study God's Word, my first question should not be, 'What am I going to say about this?'
but 'What am I going to do about this?'?
A friend once told me, 'In my lifetime I've seen a lot of things change, and I've been against them all!'
Perhaps he overstated the point, but many of us would agree that we don't like change especially if it involves altering our habits and attitudes
That's one reason Jesus was so unpopular among the Pharisees
He challenged their long-established system of good works and self-righteous living
Consider the incident when the town 'sinner' entered the home of the town 'saint' in Luke 7
Simon the Pharisee wasn't impressed with the woman's lavish display of affection for Jesus
Reading Simon's self-righteous thoughts, Jesus immediately challenged his flawed perception of his own goodness 
Jesus told the story of two debtors one who owed much to his master and one who owed less
'Which of them will love him more?'
Jesus asked
Obviously, the one who had been forgiven more
Speaking to Simon's I-feel-pretty-good-about-myself attitude, Jesus said, 'to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little'
The challenge is clear
Lulled into thinking how good we are, our love for Jesus wanes because we have forgotten that we too are among the ones 'forgiven much.'
And when that happens, ready or not, it's time for a change!
Last January, ESPN television ran a compelling feature about Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning
He had just been named the NFL's Most Valuable Player
But the feature was not about football
Instead, it explained that for several years, when certain competitors Manning admired were retiring from the NFL, he took time to handwrite a note to them, congratulating them on their careers and their character
Each recipient who was interviewed expressed deep appreciation that one of the greatest players of all time would do that
It was a great reminder of the power of the written word
While a written note from a respected athlete such as Peyton Manning has much value, no human's words can compare with the written Word we have from God in Scripture
Paul wrote, 'Whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope'
In the life-changing wisdom of the Bible, we have a personal message that tells us what God desires for us to be and what He desires to be for us
He has given us His written Word so we 'might have hope' as we face the issues of life
Out of gratitude, let's read God's written message and watch it change our lives.
A friend of mine has the opportunity each winter to attend the Super Bowl as a journalist
His job is to garner interviews with Christian athletes and National Football League personnel for a faith-based radio program
When he first started covering the big game a few years ago, he grew disillusioned with the self-serving, pleasure-seeking atmosphere during Super Bowl week
'I found it to be a very dark place,' he says
One day he told a former NFL player, a Christian, how he was feeling
The athlete looked at my friend and said, 'Brother, you are being light in this dark place.'
That comment reminded my friend why he was there, and it helped renew his excitement for serving God in a place where the light of the gospel is needed
It spurred him to shine his light
Perhaps you work in a setting where God is not acknowledged, faith is mocked, and godless living is applauded
Maybe you feel that you are going into 'a very dark place.'
Why not be a light through your smiles, kind words and deeds, and diligent work
Ask God to bring opportunities to share the good news of Jesus Christ
You may be the only light a co-worker sees today.
Pastor and author Erwin Lutzer wrote: 'One minute after you slip behind the parted curtain, you will either be enjoying a personal welcome from Christ or catching your first glimpse of gloom as you have never known it
Either way, your future will be irrevocably fixed and eternally unchangeable.'
Luke recorded a short yet powerful narrative that pictures two men about to go behind that curtain of death
When Jesus was being crucified, two thieves hung alongside Him
According to Mark, both men hurled insults at Jesus
One of the thieves, however, had a change of heart as he realized Jesus' innocence, his own sin, and his destiny
He rebuked the other thief
He asked Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom
These words were a sign of repentance and simple faith
Jesus responded, 'I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise'
Salvation for the man was immediate
It reminded me of how often I needlessly rehearse my disappointments and problems to others instead of telling them to God
The psalmist wrote: 'Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us'
Twice he spoke of waiting silently for God, his rock and salvation
I'll never forget my first experience using an automatic car wash
Approaching it with the dread of going to the dentist
I pushed the money into the slot, nervously checked and rechecked my windows, eased the car up to the line, and waited
Powers beyond my control began moving my car forward as if on a conveyor belt
There I was, cocooned inside, when a thunderous rush of water, soap, and brushes hit my car from all directions
What if I get stuck in here or water crashes in
I thought irrationally
Suddenly the waters ceased
After a blow-dry, my car was propelled into the outside world again, clean and polished
In the midst of all this, I remembered stormy times in my life when it seemed I was on a conveyor belt, a victim of forces beyond my control
'Car-wash experiences,' I now call them
I remembered that whenever I passed through deep waters my Redeemer had been with me, sheltering me against the rising tide
When I came out on the other side, which I always did, I was able to say with joy and confidence, 'He is a faithful God!'
Are you in the middle of a car-wash experience
Trust God to bring you through to the other side
You'll then be a shining testimony of His keeping power.
San Francisco and New York City are using bluegill fish to check for the presence of toxins in their water supply, which could be a possible target for a terrorist attack
A small number of bluegills are kept in a tank at the bottom of some water treatment plants because the fish are sensitive to chemical imbalances in their environment
When a disturbance is present in the water, the bluegills react against it
Like these bluegills, Paul wanted the Galatians to beware of and react against any toxic disturbance in the 'true gospel' that was being preached
The toxin was defined as the false principle that God grants acceptance to people and considers them righteous on the basis of their obedience to a set of rules
In short, obedience to the law was needed, apart from faith in Jesus
This false teaching was a toxic disturbance of the truth and the Galatians were told to react strongly against it
Paul said that anyone preaching a gospel that is not based on grace through faith in Christ alone should be accursed
Let's faithfully study the Scriptures so we can detect the toxins of false teaching and proclaim the truth of God's wonderful salvation through faith in Jesus.
During the Great Depression, many people in the US lived in shantytowns made up of plywood, tarps, and blankets
These decrepit dwellings, known as 'Hoovervilles,' housed those who had been evicted from their homes
Many blamed President Herbert Hoover for the economic woes
Ironically, Hoover's apparent ineffectiveness as a leader was in sharp contrast to his previous record
Earlier, Hoover's expertise in geological engineering led to successful mining projects in Australia and China
He also effectively spearheaded humanitarian efforts
But when the stock market crashed in October 1929, President Hoover was in circumstances beyond his control
He would be forever tied with the economic depression of the 1930s
One major fiasco, however, does not mean one's whole life is a failure
What if we remembered Abraham only as a deceiver , Moses as disobedient to God , or David as a murderer
Despite their sins, these men are remembered for their persevering faith: 'who through faith
out of weakness were made strong'
Our life is not a failure if we've repented of our sins
God can still use us to serve Him.
Chinese New Year happens to fall on the same day as Valentine's Day in 2010
While these two festivals have very different origins, there are some similarities in how they are celebrated
In both cases, loved ones give gifts to express love for one another
Whether it is giving roses to your beloved on Valentine's Day or hong bao to family and friends on Chinese New Year, they represent tokens of love
Our Lord Jesus Christ commanded His disciples to 'love one another,'
because 'by this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another'
The love that our Lord wants His disciples to have for one another is different from the romantic kind displayed between loving couples and the brotherly kind shown between friends or family
It's an unselfish love
The Greek word John used in Jesus' command is agape God's kind of love that expects nothing in return
That was what Jesus showed to His disciples when He 'poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet'
That is the kind of love He displayed when He went to the cross for us
Today, look for someone to whom you can show such unselfish love.
Many Chinese go to great lengths to attend a traditional annual reunion dinner with their families
Held on the eve of the Lunar New Year, the reunion dinner usually takes place at the home of their parents or eldest sibling
Chinese working overseas have to arrange their travel bookings early to ensure they have tickets
To fail to book early is to risk missing out on the family reunion
The Bible tells of an even more important reunion dinner in heaven
Revelation 19:9 calls it 'the marriage supper of the Lamb.'
Unlike the Lunar New Year reunion dinner, however, no one knows the date for this event except God
Nor do we have to worry about making travel arrangements
Who is invited to this heavenly reunion dinner
All those who belong to God's family will be there, 'those who believe in [Jesus'] name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God'
Will you be at the reunion dinner in heaven
You can secure your place at the heavenly banquet by trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior today.
American businessman Mark Bent has spent $250,000 to develop and manufacture an affordable solar-powered flashlight
Thousands have been distributed free or at low cost to people living in African refugee camps
One daily solar charge provides 7 hours of life-giving illumination for people in homes, schools, and medical clinics where darkness had encouraged crime and violence
The contrast between darkness and light is a prominent image in the Bible's presentation of Jesus the Messiah
'The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined'
'In [Jesus] was life, and the life was the light of men
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it'
It's our privilege as followers of Jesus to be His light-bearers today
Paul urged the Christians in Philippi to become 'blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world'
Instead of being afraid or oppressed by the spiritual darkness around us, we can rely on the grace that God gives His children to shine for Him.
When someone said to my friend, 'See you in a year,' it sounded odd when he replied, 'Yes, see you on the other side.'
He meant that he'd see him on the other side of a one-year deployment for the US Navy
But because the phrase is often used of heaven, it made me think about the uncertainty of life
I wondered, Who will be here in another year
Who might by then be on the other side in heaven
We certainly don't know what the next year or hour will bring
In his epistle, James wrote about this uncertainty
He rebuked the greedy merchants for boasting about what they would do that day, the next day, or even the next year
Their sin wasn't that they were making plans; it was forgetting God and arrogantly boasting about those business plans
James reminded them: 'What is your life
It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away'
Commentator Peter Davids says that James was pointing out their foolishness and saying, in essence, 'Come now, you who make plans you don't even understand how little control you have over life itself.'
No part of life is outside the control of God
So when we make plans, we need to remember, 'If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that'
I watch the fluctuations of the stock market and reflect on the effects of fear and greed
A character in a 1980s movie had this philosophy: 'Greed, for lack of a better word, is good
Greed is right
Greed works
Greed [will] save
the USA!'
What foolish thinking
I think of that occasion when a man asked Jesus to serve as an arbiter and make his brother share their inheritance
Jesus refused the request but went on to do the man a greater kindness
He pointed out the motive behind the man's request and its consequences: 'Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses'
Dr Scott Kurtzman, chief of surgery at Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut
He was on his way to deliver a lecture when he witnessed a horrible crash involving 20 vehicles
The doctor shifted into trauma mode, worked his way through the mess of metal, and called out, 'Who needs help?'
After 90 minutes of assisting, and the victims were taken to area hospitals, Dr Kurtzman commented, 'A person with my skills simply can't drive by someone who is injured
I refuse to live my life that way.'
Jesus told a parable about a man who stopped to help another
A Jewish man had been ambushed, stripped, robbed, and left for dead
A Jewish priest and a temple assistant passed by, saw the man, and crossed over to the other side
Then a despised Samaritan came by
He saw the man, and was filled with compassion
His compassion was translated into action: He soothed and bandaged the man's wounds, took him to an inn, cared for him while he could, paid for all his medical expenses, and then promised the innkeeper he would return to pay any additional expenses
There are people around us who are suffering
Moved with compassion for their pain, let's be those who stop to help.
In June 2009, 95-year-old Emma Gray died
For over two decades, she had been the cleaning lady in a big house
Each night as she did her work, she prayed for blessings, wisdom, and safety for the man she worked for
Although Emma worked in the same place for 24 years, the occupants of the residence changed every 4 years or so
Over the years, Emma offered her nightly prayers for six US Presidents: Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter
Emma had her personal favorites, but she prayed for them all
She followed the instruction we read in 1 Timothy 2 to pray for 'all who are in authority'
The verses go on to speak of how living 'a quiet and peaceable life'
and being a godly and reverent person 'is good and acceptable in the sight of God
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth'
Because God 'hears the prayer of the righteous'
, who knows how He used Emma's faithful prayers
In Proverbs 21:1, we read: 'The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, like the rivers of water; He turns it wherever He wishes.'
Like Emma, we are to pray for our leaders
Is there someone God is calling you to pray for today?
Not fair!'
Whether you've said it or at least thought it, you've got to admit, it's hard to see someone get away with something and not get what they deserve
We learn this early in life
Just ask the parent of any teenager
Kids hate to see their siblings get off scot-free for the things they got spanked for
Which is why they so readily tattle on each other
But then, we never really grow out of this
To our way of thinking, fairness means sinners deserve God's wrath and we, the good people, deserve His applause
But if God were into being 'fair,'
we would all be consumed by His judgment
We can be thankful for this: '[God] has not dealt with us according to our sins'
We should be glad, not grumpy, that God chooses mercy over fairness and that He is willing to extend grace even to those who are undeserving and hopelessly lost
And while we are thinking about it, when was the last time we let mercy trump fairness with someone who offended us
It's not God's fairness but His mercy that drives Him to pursue us so that heaven can have a party when we are found
Personally, I'm thankful that God has not been 'fair' with me
Recently I was fishing with some friends and waded into a current that was too strong for my old legs
I should have known better; it's a well-known fact that you can wade into flows that you can't back out of
I got that panicky feeling you get when you realize you're in deep trouble
One more step and I would have been swept away
I did the only thing I could think of: I called out to a friend nearby who is younger and stronger than I
'Hey, Pete!'
'Give me a hand, will you?'
My friend waded into the current, reached out his strong hand, and pulled me into quiet water
A few days later as I read Psalm 119, I came across verse 173: 'Let Your hand become my help.'
I thought of that day on the stream and other days when I have 'waded'
into difficult situations, overestimating my feeble abilities and putting myself or my loved ones in jeopardy
Perhaps you find yourself in that place today
There is help nearby, a Friend much stronger than you and I, one whose hand can hold us
The psalmist also says of Him, 'You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand'
You can call out to God: 'Give me a hand!'
and He will rush to your side.
Last week I had several opportunities to show grace
I wasn't perfect, but I was pleased with the way I handled one situation in particular
Instead of getting angry, I said, 'I understand how that could have happened
I've certainly made my share of mistakes,'
and I left it at that
According to my own grading scale, I deserved a high score
Not perfect, but close
Lurking in the back of my mind was the thought that maybe by being gracious I could expect to be treated that way at some future date
The following Sunday morning our congregation was singing 'Amazing Grace,'
and suddenly the audacity of my attitude came through to me in the words, 'Amazing grace How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.'
What in the world was I thinking?
The grace we show to others is not our own
The only reason we can 'give' grace to anyone is because God has already given it to us
We can pass along only that which we have received from Him
Good stewards look for opportunities to pass along to others what we have received from the Lord
May all of us be 'good stewards of the manifold grace of God'
Corporal Desmond Doss was the first conscientious objector to earn the Congressional Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military award
A devout follower of Christ, Doss believed that it was not right for him to kill others, but he wanted to serve his country so he volunteered as a medic
During boot camp, his fellow soldiers ridiculed him for refusing to fire a rifle
They mocked him when he read his Bible and knelt beside his bunk at night to pray
But in combat, it was a different story
During the World War II battle for Okinawa in May 1945, Doss repeatedly risked his life to rescue scores of wounded men
Through his unselfish actions, he earned the gratitude and respect of his former critics and of those whose lives he saved
In the face of unjust criticism, Peter told his fellow Christians, 'Even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed
'\sAnd do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled'
He urged them to honor God in their hearts and be ready to give a respectful reply to anyone who asked about the hope within them
May our response to a hurting world that's often hostile to Christ be one that demonstrates God's love.
One of the great privileges of serving at Moody Bible Institute was hearing about graduates who had impacted the world for Christ
Their stories of sacrifice, perseverance, and passion for the gospel were inspiring
In the late 19th century, Mary McLeod Bethune spent 2 years studying at Moody in Chicago, training to become a missionary in Africa
But after she graduated, no mission board would give her the opportunity, as an African-American woman, to serve on the mission field
Unable to fulfill her dream to go to Africa, she didn't give up on her calling to serve Jesus
Undaunted, she started a small school for African-American girls in Florida that would eventually blossom into Bethune-Cookman College
She became a powerful force for change in the status of women
Mary's legacy was forged by her determination to serve Jesus even in the face of shattered dreams
She knew that God had entrusted to her 'the ministry of reconciliation'
, and she wouldn't give up
That wasn't just a mandate for Mary McLeod Bethune
Telling people they can be reconciled to God through Christ is a calling given to all of us
Look for a way to make a difference for Jesus today, right where you are!
Answering media charges of scandal and impropriety, the guilty politician responded with the plea, 'I have no recollection of those events.'
It was yet another attempt of a public figure to apply a strategy called 'plausible deniability.'
This is when individuals try to create a personal safety net for themselves by seeking to convince others that they had no knowledge of the events in question
Someone else gets blamed and becomes the scapegoat for the guilty person's wrongs
Sometimes Christians have their own kind of plausible deniability
We claim ignorance of our wrong behavior, rationalize, or blame others, but God knows the truth
The Bible tells us: 'Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart'
This is true whether the heart is pure or if it's a corrupt heart robed in false claims of innocence
We may fool others who see us only on the outside, but God sees the reality of our hearts, whether good or bad
It is wise, therefore, to humbly confess our faults to the Lord
He desires that we admit the truth
The only way to escape the sin and restore our fellowship with God is to acknowledge and confess it to Him .
Matt Emmons, Olympic gold medalist in rifle shooting in 2004, was set to win another event at Athens
He had a commanding lead and hoped to make a direct bull's-eye on his last shot
But something went wrong, he hit the target, but he was aiming at the wrong one
That wrong focus dropped him to eighth place and cost him a medal
In Paul's letter to the Philippians, he expressed the importance of focusing on the right target in our Christian life
'I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus,' he said
Paul used the term 'goal'
in an illustration of an athlete running a race
Interestingly, the same word was also used of a target for shooting arrows
In both cases, the prospect of winning depends on being focused
For the believer that focus should be a lifetime pursuit of becoming more like our Savior Jesus Christ
What is your focus today
Are you preoccupied with getting ahead and making life more comfortable
If you're a believer, the right target to shoot for is to become more like the Son of God
Today make sure you are aiming at the right target!
For most English-speaking people, the acronym ASAP means 'As Soon As Possible'
or immediately
But for the Christian it can also mean, 'Always Say A Prayer.'
King Hezekiah was one of Judah's best kings
He restored the worship of God to his nation after his father Ahaz's evil reign
Yet when the Assyrian king attacked Judah, Hezekiah capitulated to the king and stripped off the gold from the temple in Jerusalem to placate him
That did not satisfy the Assyrian king, however, who returned to issue another threat
It was then that Hezekiah turned to the Lord
He prayed, 'You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth
Save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God, You alone'
When Hezekiah prayed, God answered him in a remarkable way and delivered him from his enemies
You may be facing a problem that leaves you feeling helpless
It may be the loss of a job, a difficult family or work situation, or health struggles
We have a powerful God to whom we can bring our concerns
So before you do anything else, remember to ASAP, Always Say A Prayer.
An African proverb states, 'The one who asks questions doesn't lose his way.'
That concept can be helpful as we consider David's questions in the Psalms
He was clearly seeking God's guidance for the way he should go
Look, for example, at some of the questions he asked: 'O Lord, how long?'
A question of eagerness to see God's plan accomplished
'What is man that You are mindful of him?'
A question of awe that God even cares about sinful man
'Why do You hide in times of trouble?'
A question that reveals a longing for God's presence
'Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle
Who may dwell in Your holy hill?'
The ultimate question of who may live with God
David had some tough questions for God
He had discovered what it was like to lose his way when he excluded God and followed his own sinful path
But as he penned the Psalms, he was a man in search of godliness, which meant he probed God's mind about difficult subjects
Questions Like David, you have them
Keep asking
Then, through faith in God's Word and the work of the Holy Spirit, listen as He leads you in His way.
Every Memorial Day, we remember those who have died in the service of their country
In the United States, a place where such remembrances carry a deep and emotional significance is Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington, DC
Arlington is a serious place where, due to the passing of aging war veterans and the ongoing conflicts around the world
there are currently about 25 military funerals every day
This is particularly difficult for The Old Guard members of the 3rd US Infantry Regiment who serve at Arlington
It is their task to bear the bodies of the fallen and honor their sacrifice
The members of The Old Guard never forget the price of liberty for they are reminded of it every day
Believers in Christ have been given the Lord's Supper as a reminder of what our freedom from sin cost the Lord Jesus Christ
As we partake of the bread and the cup, we fulfill His command to 'do this in remembrance of Me'
But in the sober celebration of the sacrifice of Christ there is joy
For we need not leave our remembrances at the Lord's Table
Living our lives for the Savior can show the world that we will never forget the sacrifice He has made for us.
Today's technology allows some people to work 24/7
We can bring our work home or take it on vacation
Work is ever-present with us, except when the electricity goes off
An ice storm last winter covered several states in a thick glasslike glaze
Trees and branches fell, blocking roads and keeping people home
Power lines fell, leaving people in cold darkness
The are unable to accomplish anything that required electricity
Whenever something like this interrupts my life, I realize how important my own work is to me
Without it, I feel unimportant, unproductive, and useless
But God doesn't want work to be that important to us, and we shouldn't need a power outage to get us to stop
In the Old Testament, God had a plan for getting His people to stop and pay attention to Him
It was called Sabbath
On the seventh day of the week, they were to stop their work
Although New Testament believers aren't required to keep this law, rest is still important
Practicing a day of rest can keep us from the faulty belief that our work is more important than God's
What does it take to make you stop and pay attention to God?
While a friend and I walked along the path of the former Berlin Wall, he told me, 'This is one of those '\snever say never' places in my life.'
He explained that during the years when the Wall divided the city, he had made a dozen trips through Checkpoint Charlie to encourage members of the church living under continuing surveillance and opposition in East Germany
More than once, he had been detained, questioned, and harassed by the border guards
In 1988, he took his teenage children to West Berlin and told them, 'Take a good look at this wall, because someday when you bring your children here, this wall will still be standing.'
A year later it was gone
When Saul of Tarsus began to attack the followers of Jesus, no one could have imagined that he would ever become a disciple of Christ
'Never
Not a chance.'
Yet Acts 9:1-9 records the story of Saul's blinding encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus
Within a few days of that life-changing event, Saul was preaching in the synagogues of Damascus that Jesus was the Son of God, to the astonishment of all who heard him
When it comes to God's work in the most difficult people we know, we should never say 'never.'
In a message to the 2002 graduates of Cedarville University, Dr Paul Dixon encouraged them with these words: 'Your times are in God's hands.'
Our family listened and thought it was appropriate for the graduates, which included our daughter Julie
We had no idea that in 5 days our 17-year-old Melissa would graduate to heaven through a car accident and we would be left to recall with new meaning that thought from Psalm 31:15
Over the years, we have become painfully aware that in God's mysterious ways, He has planned for some Christians a life that is short
I think of one young Christian girl, the kind with a smile for everyone, who had a sore finger and a week later was dead from a raging infection
Or the young believer who was killed while playing softball when a ball hit her in the neck
Or the teen boy who loved Jesus and fishing
and died when a car hit him as he rode his bike home from the fishing hole
Melissa, Heather, Maggie, and Thomas
In their short lives, they created a legacy of faith in Jesus and love for others
They were ready when His time for them had come
'I trust in You,' the psalmist said
recognizing that his life was in God's hands alone
Are you trusting God for whatever comes next on your calendar?
In her fascinating book Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, Ruth Reichl reflects on her 6 years as a New York Times restaurant critic
Because she was the most influential critic in the country, top restaurants posted her photograph so their employees could recognize her
Hoping to earn a high rating in the New York Times, the staff intended to provide her with their top service and best cuisine
In response, Reichl developed a clever strategy
Hoping to be treated as a regular patron, she disguised herself
On one occasion, she dressed up as an old woman
The restaurant made her wait a long time to be seated and then was unresponsive to her requests
In the early church, James spoke out against favoritism: '[If] you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, '\sYou sit here in a good place,' and say to the poor man, '\sYou stand there,' or, '\sSit here at my footstool,' have you not shown partiality among yourselves?'
When people attend our churches, are they treated impartially
Or do we show favoritism to the wealthy or elite
God calls us to show concern for and interest in all people, regardless of their social status
Let's welcome all to join us in worshiping the King!
My Australian friend Graham wasn't born blind
He was blinded by a freak accident at age 9
Yet he never felt sorry for himself
Wherever he went, he shared what Jesus Christ meant to him
His last trip was to Thailand as a practicing physiotherapist
Besides using his professional skills there, he wanted to share the gospel of Christ
The four lepers in 2 Kings 7 had some good news to share as well
They had stumbled into the Syrian camp and found it deserted
After helping themselves to the food and loot, they remembered the starving people of Samaria, shut in as a result of a Syrian siege
Their response was: 'We are not doing right
This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent'
So they went and told their fellow Israelites about the provisions
Despite their physical and social disadvantages, both Graham and the lepers thought about others
They were thankful for what they had found and considered it too good to keep to themselves
Do you know someone who needs to know what Jesus has done
Don't make excuses for what you lack in abilities
Instead, share the good news of what the Lord has done for you, and your life will take on new purpose.
John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prizewinning novel The Grapes of Wrath begins with a scene in drought-ravaged Oklahoma during the Great Depression
With the crops dying and the land choked by dust, the women watched the men to see if they would break under the strain
When they saw the men's will to carry on, they took heart
Steinbeck writes, 'Women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole.'
The issue was not happiness, prosperity, or satisfaction, but wholeness
This is the great need of us all
In the King James Version of the Bible, the word whole is often used to describe Jesus' work of physical healing
When the Lord encountered a man who had been an invalid for 38 years, He asked, 'Wilt thou be made whole?'
After Jesus healed the man, He challenged him to also embrace spiritual wholeness: 'See, you have been made well
Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you'
If we only want something Jesus can do for us, our relationship with Him will be limited
When we want Jesus Himself, He brings completeness to our lives
Christ wants, first and foremost, to make us whole.
The Scripture reading from Luke 18 about children seemed unusual at the memorial service for David Holquist
After all, he was 77 when he died
Yet the pastor said the verses fit David, a long-time college professor, perfectly
Part of his legacy was that he took time for children, his own and others'
He made balloon animals and puppets
David also helped in a puppet ministry at church
When planning worship services with others, he frequently asked, 'What about the children?'
He was concerned about what would help the children not just the adults to worship God
Luke 18 shows us the concern Jesus had for children
When people brought little ones to Him, the disciples wanted to protect Jesus, a busy man, from the bothersome children
Just the opposite
The Bible says that Jesus was 'greatly displeased'
at the disciples, and said, 'Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them'
Mark adds that Jesus took them in His arms and blessed them
Let's examine our own attitude about children and then follow the example of David Holquist
Find some ways to help them come to Jesus.
When it comes to communication, our world is becoming increasingly high-tech
The popularity of things like Twitter and Facebook might cause some to think the Bible is too old-school
The tech-savvy people of our world might feel deterred because there are no sounds and no nifty graphics in the Bible
But the truth is, there's more high-tech power in God's Word than in any cutting-edge communication tool our world will ever know
It's not uncommon for a pastor to be told, 'When you said that in your message, it was just what I needed.'
Somehow during the sermon, God spoke to the person's heart with a message tailor-made for him or her
If you've ever read the Bible and sensed God speaking directly to you, you know what I'm talking about
God has hard-wired you with His Spirit, who illumines your mind to understand His Word
Imagine getting a 'text message'
directly from the Creator of the universe telling you exactly what you need at exactly the right time
No matter how high-tech this world gets, you'll never experience a more powerful mode of communication
Rejoice in the reality that 'we have received the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God'
Before they were a week old, the eaglets were fighting over food
Neither was strong enough to hold up his head for more than a few seconds, so the pair looked like fuzzballs with bobble-heads attached
But whenever the parents brought food to the nest, the bigger eaglet was quick to peck down his brother to keep him from getting a single bite
His aggression would have been understandable if food was scarce, or if the parents couldn't be trusted to supply what he needed
But nothing could be further from the truth
The eaglets were being fed fish many times their size; there was more than enough for both of them
The greedy eaglet reminds me of our own foolishness when we try to get for ourselves something that belongs to someone else
Conflicts erupt because we want something that God has given to a friend, colleague, relative, or neighbor
Instead of asking God for what we need, we try to get what He's given to someone else
But God has something good for each of us
We don't need what belongs to anyone else
And we certainly never need to harm anyone to get what we need
Our loving heavenly Father has more than enough for everyone.
In 1970, the Beatles began work on a documentary intended to show how their music was made
But instead of revealing the process of musical creativity, the film pulled the curtain back on a display of self-interest and bickering
The band members were more concerned about their own songs than the advancement of the group
Shortly after the project was completed, the group dissolved in disharmony and broken friendships
It's an age-old problem
In the first century AD, the apostle Paul feared that the believers in the church at Philippi would fall into the trap of selfishness
He knew that when the desire for personal advancement overrides concern for one another, attitudes quickly become disruptive and divisive
To counteract this dangerous tendency, Paul wrote, 'Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others'
What would a documentary of your life reveal
Selfishness or selflessness
We must look out for one another, for selfless concern will prevent division and build unity in our church families.
I was delighted when a mutual friend gave my neighbor a Bible
But my neighbor told me she stopped reading it because she couldn't understand why God would be so unfair as to reject Cain's offering
'After all,' she said, 'as a farmer, he simply brought to God what he had
Did God expect him to buy a different kind of sacrifice?'
Sadly, she had missed the point
It wasn't that God didn't like vegetables
Rather, He knew that Cain's offering was masking an unrighteous attitude
Cain wasn't fully committed to God, as expressed by the fact that he wasn't living according to His ways
It's easy to worship God on the outside while stubbornly keeping territory from Him on the inside
Jude writes about outwardly religious people who use religious activities to cover the reality of their sinful lives: 'Woe to them For they have gone in the way of Cain'
We can faithfully serve God, sing His praises, and give sacrificially to His work
But God doesn't want any of that without our hearts
Does the Lord take priority over our plans and dreams
Is He worth more than the sin that tempts us
When we express to Him that He is more worthy than anything or anyone else in our lives, it's an offering He won't refuse.
When I was growing up in Singapore, I remember that some of my school friends were kicked out of their homes by their non-Christian parents for daring to believe in Jesus Christ
They suffered for their beliefs and emerged with stronger convictions
By contrast, I was born and raised in a Christian family
Though I didn't suffer persecution, I too had to make my convictions my own
The Israelites who first entered the Promised Land with Joshua saw the mighty acts of God and believed
But sadly, the very next generation 'did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel'
So it was not long before they turned aside to worship other gods
They didn't make their parents' faith their own
No generation can live off the faith of the previous generation
Every generation needs a firsthand faith
When faced with trouble of any kind, the faith that is not personalized is likely to drift and falter
Those who are second, third, or even fourth generation Christians have a wonderful legacy, to be sure
However, there's no secondhand faith
Find out what God says in His Word and personalize it so that yours is a fresh, firsthand faith .
In 1935, the debate team of Wiley College, a small and unranked black school in Texas, unexpectedly defeated the all-white championship team from the University of Southern California
This was a classic case of the unknown triumphing over a national giant
When ancient Israel was in peril at the hands of the Philistines, there was a boy named David who actually triumphed over a giant
The armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the Valley of Elah
They were probably afraid of one another and decided that the outcome of the battle should be determined by a battle of champions
The Philistines offered Goliath, a giant , but Israel could not find anyone who was worthy or brave enough to fight
David heard of the dilemma and appealed to Saul to let him fight Goliath
Saul was reluctant, but he agreed
David, armed with five smooth stones and unswerving faith in the Almighty God , triumphed over the Philistines' national champion
We all face giants in our lives worry, doubt, fear, sin, and guilt
But with limited and unlikely resources and unswerving confidence in our all-powerful God, we too can triumph over them.
Not long ago, I attended a class in origami
I learned that the term comes from two Japanese words that mean 'folding paper.'
In this process, a piece of paper is transformed into a bird or other unique shape by a series of geometric folds and creases
Our facilitator was Hitoshiro Akehi, a Japanese brother in Christ
As we folded our paper into different shapes, Mr Akehi shared some of his life experiences
The youngest of 11 children, he was raised by his mother after his father died during World War II
Through many twists and turns, his family came into contact with missionaries
As a result, many of his family members became Christians
As I refashioned a simple piece of paper into a beautiful new form, I thought of how God shapes us
First, He uses circumstances to bring us to our knees and to Him
Then, by grace He continues to use life's twists and turns to reshape us into more Christlike persons, 'conformed to the image of His Son'
Has your life taken an unexpected turn
Remember, in the hands of our Creator and Redeemer, we are '[God's] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus'
We are His unfinished works of art
God can use the twists and turns in our lives to make us more like His Son.
When the husband of my longtime friend and publishing colleague collapsed and later died, there was no doubt that life had slipped away from him
There were witnesses
The same was true when Jesus died
But three days later, Jesus was raised from the dead
We have no doubt that this is true because there were witnesses who later saw Him alive
When we gathered for Dave's memorial service, we read familiar passages of Scripture that affirm our hope that he is now enjoying new life in heaven
But we claimed these promises by faith because none of us witnessed Dave go to heaven
There was, however, a witness who saw Jesus in heaven
Not long after witnesses saw Jesus ascend , Stephen saw the heavens open 'and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!'
One of the reasons we know that Jesus spoke the truth about going to prepare a place for us is that He has been seen alive in heaven
When a loved one goes ahead of us to heaven, we feel as if we're being pulled in the opposite direction down into an abyss of sadness
Yet, because God kept His promise to raise Christ and take Him to heaven, we can trust Him to do the same for all who love and follow Him.
When Charles Hayward died last May at the age of 87, he left a legacy for his children and grandchildren
He and his wife Virginia had faithfully served as missionaries for many years both in India and South Africa
But at age 73, he began to select and memorize portions of Scripture so he would 'finish well' with his mind full of God's truth
He called his project, 'The Whole Bible Memorization Plan.'
His children call it, 'Charlie's List.'
Charles chose a theme verse , at least one verse from each Old Testament book, at least one from each New Testament narrative book, and a verse or verses from each chapter of the New Testament Epistles
He began with Genesis 15:6, 'He believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness'
and ended with Revelation 22:17, 'Let him who thirsts come
Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.'
All in all, Charles committed 239 verses to memory
He reminds me of the psalmist who wrote: 'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You'
Like Charles, the psalmist meditated and delighted in God's Word
What better goal could any of us have than to fill our minds with God's truth.
In one of Joe Morgenstern's weekly Wall Street Journal columns about movies, he considered the impact of the great film stars in close-up scenes where they said nothing at all
'Movie stars,' he wrote, 'can do as little as they do at crucial moments because, having already earned our respect, they can assume that we're paying attention.'
This quality of powerful silence that we admire in actors and actresses, however, can be frustrating or disappointing in our relationship with God when He is silent
When Lazarus, a close friend of Jesus, became seriously ill, his sisters Mary and Martha sent word to Jesus
But 'when [Jesus] heard that [Lazarus] was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was'
Commenting on this passage, Oswald Chambers said: 'Has God trusted you with a silence' a silence that is big with meaning
Think of those days of absolute silence in the home at Bethany
Is there anything analogous to those days in your life
His silence is the sign that He is bringing you into a marvellous understanding of Himself
If God has given you a silence, praise Him, He is bringing you into the great run of His purposes.'
We can trust our loving Lord, even when He is silent.
Some mornings as I leave for work, my wife says to me, 'Don't forget to
Later in the day, she'll phone me and ask, 'Did you forget?'
We all have a tendency to forget
I think that may be why God repeats important truths to us
Twice in Deuteronomy 24, the Lord reminded the Israelites that they were slaves in Egypt but they had been rescued and redeemed by Him
Through Moses, He told them, 'You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you from there'
Because they had been redeemed, the Israelites had certain responsibilities that the Lord wanted them to remember
Moses said, 'I command you to do this thing'
What was 'this thing'?
They were told to care for 'the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow'
If part of the harvest was left in the fields, they were to leave it for these needy people
He reminds them of the people in verses 20 and 21 also
We are redeemed people through Jesus' death on the cross and His resurrection
We too are told numerous times to be willing to share with those in need
Hebrews 13:16 says, 'Do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.'?
A group of teenagers on a ministry trip in Jamaica were enjoying some downtime with a game of Ultimate Frisbee
But when someone noticed that a boat had overturned off a nearby beach, the game ended and the teens eagerly rushed to the water to help
There they found a small group of professional boat operators struggling with their craft trying to turn it upright
That's where the teens could help
They waded in, put their young strength to work, and together they were able to right the boat
What happened that day in the Caribbean Sea reminds me of what can happen in the church
The 'professionals,' the pastor and others who are trained to lead the church, face a task they can't do alone
It's often a struggle to get the work of the church done until laypeople join in and work alongside the leadership
This was the situation in Acts 6
Some people in the church were being neglected, and the 'professionals,' the apostles who were leading the church, realized they couldn't do everything by themselves
Only when seven laypeople pitched in to help the leaders could the church proceed
How can you come alongside your pastor and other leaders to help keep your church moving ahead?
Cartoonist Scott Adams has become famous for his humorous cartoon strip 'Dilbert.'
He also wrote a book in the 1990s called The Dilbert Principle
In it he mocks technology, leadership fads, and incompetent managers
Many laugh out loud at the connections the book makes with their own work-a-day world
Regarding employee laziness and deceit, the author writes: 'When it comes to avoiding work, it is fair to say I studied with the masters
After nine years
I learned just about everything there is to know about looking busy without actually being busy.'
Believers, however, have a much higher calling when it comes to dealing with employers
In the Scriptures, we are encouraged to exhibit a respectful attitude toward those who supervise us: 'Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart'
The right work ethic begins with a heart of sincerity in which we consider Jesus Christ our employer
We please Him when we diligently serve our boss and others in the workplace.
A couple of weeks ago my wife met a woman who needed a ride
She sensed that this could be from God, so she agreed to take her to her destination
During the ride, the woman revealed to my wife that she was a believer but she struggled with drug addiction
My wife listened to and talked with this hurting woman
As she gave her hope for a better tomorrow, I believe that the woman experienced in some small way a little piece of heaven on earth
When God instructed Moses to build the tabernacle according to His specifications, it was so that God's people would sense His presence
I like to think of it as a little piece of heaven on earth
The temple was a physical example of God's presence on earth also
The purpose of these holy places was for God to dwell among His people
This was God's plan when Jesus, the perfect temple, 'tabernacled' among us
When Jesus ascended to heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit to indwell His followers , so that we would be God's tabernacles and temples in the world
As God's representatives of His presence, let's find ways to bring the peace and hope of heaven to others on earth.
The Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, Ireland, houses a wonderful collection of ancient Bible fragments
One very small fragment is a portion of John 19
This piece of John's gospel describes the moment, as Jesus was being crucified, when He spoke to His mother in a display of love and concern for her
The words are from verse 26, where we read, 'When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, '\sWoman, behold your son!' '
As I stared at that ancient fragment, it struck me afresh how tangible Jesus' love was for His mother and friend
With clear words He let the world know of His love and affection by showing His concern that Mary be cared for by His friend John when He was gone
Hanging on the cross, Jesus said to John, ''\sBehold your mother!' And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home'
I think that today, on this Mother's Day, would be a wonderful time to declare publicly your love for your mom if you still have her or to give thanks to the Lord for her if she is no longer with you
Then show in some tangible ways how much you love her and how much she has meant to you.
When the horrors of war visited the civilians of Nanjing, China, women were not spared in the mounting violence and many were assaulted and killed
In this threatening environment, Minnie Vautrin took heroic measures to protect Chinese women from harm
Serving as a missionary teacher at Ginling College in Nanjing, Minnie cooperated with Chinese nationals, missionaries, surgeons, and business people and turned the college into a 'safety zone,' a place of refuge for thousands of women and girls
In the Bible, we learn that Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, were in need of some protection too
To survive as widows, they had to glean what they could from the harvested fields
As was the custom, Ruth sought a 'kinsman redeemer.'
This was a next of kin or close relative to her deceased husband who would marry her to continue the family line
Boaz was just such a man
He was touched by Ruth's sacrificial care for Naomi and her desire to look for refuge in the Lord
Boaz worked honorably to 'redeem' Ruth and to make her his wife
He then provided for her and Naomi
Our ultimate refuge is in the Lord Himself
Yet He wants to use us as instruments to provide a 'safety zone' for others. 
I have learned much about the conscious remembrance of God from Brother Lawrence, a cook in a 17th-century monastery
In his book The Practice of the Presence of God, Brother Lawrence mentioned practical ways to 'offer God your heart from time to time in the course of the day,'
even in the midst of chores such as cooking or repairing shoes
One's depth of spirituality, said Lawrence, does not depend on changing things you do but rather changing your motive doing for God what you ordinarily do for yourself
One of his eulogies said, 'The good Brother found God everywhere, as much while he was repairing shoes as while he was praying
It was God, not the task, he had in view
He knew that the more the task was against his natural inclinations, the greater was his love in offering it to God.'
That last comment affected my wife deeply
While working with senior citizens in downtown Chicago, she at times was called to do tasks that went beyond her natural inclinations
As she tackled some of the least desirable duties, she reminded herself to keep God and His glory in view
With effort, even the most difficult tasks can be performed and presented as an offering to God .
Historian Cassius Dio recorded a revealing event from the life of Hadrian, the Roman Emperor from ad 117-138
'Once, when a woman made a request of [Hadrian] as he passed by on a journey
he at first said to her, '\sI haven't time,' but afterwards, when she cried out, '\sCease, then, being emperor,' he turned about and granted her a hearing.'
How often we say or hear, 'Not now, I'm busy'
or 'I'm sorry, but I just don't have time.'
Yet, our heavenly Father, the Master and Creator of everything, always has time for us
The psalmist wrote: 'The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry
The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles'
God is not like the emperor or a busy executive who tries to avoid interruption
Instead, the Father's joy is to listen and respond to His children
'The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves such as have a contrite spirit'
Hadrian's afterthought was, 'I must take time for my subjects.'
God's first thought is, 'I always have time for those who come to Me.'
Whenever we need to talk, the Lord is ready to listen.
We may have secret longings too deep to utter to others perhaps a desire for marriage, or a work or ministry we'd like to perform, or a special place to serve
We must put each desire in God's hands and pray, 'Lord, You must choose for me
I will not choose for myself.'
Genesis 13:10-11 tells us that Lot made his own choice about a desire he had
He 'lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord
Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan.'
The plain of Jordan, with its rich soil and copious water supply, looked best to Lot
But the land was polluted with wickedness
Pastor Ray Stedman wrote that 'Lot, presuming to run his own life, '\schose for himself,' and, deceived by what he saw, stumbled blindly into heartache and judgment
Abram, on the other hand, was content to let God choose for him
Abram saw it in its true light.'
Lot chose for himself and lost everything his family, his fortune, his favor with man
It is always the best course for us to let God choose and to follow His direction, knowing as we do that all our heavenly Father's choices are prompted by infinite wisdom and love.
In 1826, the British author Thomas Carlyle married Jane Welsh, who also was an accomplished writer
She dedicated herself to his success and served him wholeheartedly
Because of a stomach ailment and a nervous disorder, he had a rather ornery temperament
So she made special meals for him and tried to keep the house as quiet as possible so he could do his writing
Thomas didn't often recognize Jane's helpful spirit nor did he spend much time with her
However, he wrote this about her to his mother: 'I may say in my heart that she loves me with a devotedness which is a mystery to me how I have ever deserved
She looks with such soft cheerfulness into my gloomy countenance, that new hope passed into me every time I met her eye.'
We too have Someone who loves us with a devotedness that is a mystery how we as sinners ever deserved it
He is God the Father, 'who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all'
His love is wide, long, deep, and high and exceeds our knowledge
Understanding and appreciating God's love is so vital that Paul prayed for the Ephesians to be 'rooted and grounded' in it
May that be our experience as well.
I heard a teenager from a Christian family declare, 'My mom doesn't think swear words are bad.'
He then indicated which words she found acceptable words that have long been considered inappropriate
Society's standard of language has declined in recent years, but we don't have to decline with it
As we strive to be 'very careful how [we] live'
we should think about how to honor God with our words
We please the Lord with our tongue when we show discernment
'He who restrains his lips is wise,' Proverbs 10:19 reminds us 
When we do speak, we are to filter the words that escape our lips: 'Whoever guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from troubles'
It is important to use kind, positive words even to address tough subjects
'A harsh word stirs up anger,'
but 'the tongue of the wise uses knowledge rightly'
Finally, avoid words that reflect poorly on who we are as God's children
Paul's admonition to 'let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth'
sets a strong standard for the righteous use of words
To honor God in each part of life, use words that are pleasing and acceptable to a holy God.
In his sermon titled 'What Is the Recession For?' pastor John Piper suggests that when the economy plummets, God has His own purposes Some of them might be
1 To expose hidden sin and so bring us to repentance and cleansing
2 To wake us up to the constant and desperate condition of the developing world, where there is always and only recession of the worst kind
3 To relocate the roots of our joy in His grace rather than in our goods, in His mercy rather than in our money, in His worth rather than in our wealth
4 To advance His saving mission in the world, the spread of the gospel and the growth of His church, precisely at a time when human resources are least able to support it
5 To bring His church to care for its hurting members and to grow in the gift of love
What else does God want to teach us in difficult times
That nothing is impossible with Him
That He who owns 'the cattle on a thousand hills'
is not limited by an economic downturn
That God hasn't placed a moratorium on the Great Commission nor abandoned us
Let's not put our hopes on worldly prosperity, but on the One who owns it all!
When it comes to jigsaw puzzles, we all know that to enjoy a satisfying outcome you need all the pieces
In many ways, life is like that
We spend our days putting it together, hoping to create a complete picture out of all the scattered parts
Yet sometimes it seems like a piece is missing
Perhaps we've been pursuing the wrong pieces to the puzzle
Even though we may know that life without God at the center is a life that has lost the most important piece, 
do we live as though He isn't particularly relevant
And even though we may attend church regularly, is He the throbbing center of our lives
Sometimes we grow accustomed to feeling distant from God
This makes it easier to sin, complicating the sense that something important is missing
But no matter how far we may drift from God, He wants us near
He appealed to His people through the prophet Isaiah: 'Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy
Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in abundance'
If something is missing in your life, remember that God is the only One who can fully and abundantly satisfy you
Let Him complete the picture of your life.
Today is National Honesty Day in the United States
It is a little-known designation for April 30, but an important one nonetheless
Author M Hirsh Goldberg established National Honesty Day in the early 1990s as a way to honor the honorable and encourage honesty
He said that April 30 was selected because 'April begins with a day dedicated to lying [April Fool's Day] and should end on a higher moral note.'
Honesty Day would be a good time to review the value of this trait according to God's Word
Honesty is not as easy as it seems but we please God by striving for it
An understanding of honesty begins with recognizing that God 'our ultimate example' is truth and that He cannot lie
Also, He hates falsehood
Beyond that, all lies have as their originator Satan himself
For our part, we can use these Scriptures as our guide: 'A righteous man hates lying'
; love rejoices in truth ; lying is part of the old nature ; growth means setting aside deceit ; and speaking truth declares righteousness
Let's make every day Honesty Day.
Is your life too busy
Business deadlines, productivity quotas, and shuttling children to lessons and sporting events can really fill up your schedule
It's easy to think, If only I didn't have so many responsibilities, then I could walk in vital union with God
Yet C S Lewis wisely points out that no one was busier than Christ
'Our model is the Jesus
of the workshop, the roads, the crowds, the clamorous demands and surly oppositions, the lack of all peace and privacy, the interruptions
For this is the Divine life operating under human conditions.'
We read of Jesus in Capernaum: 'At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed
And the whole city was gathered together at the door
Then He healed many'
The next day Christ sought out a solitary place and prayed
There He received direction from His Father to pursue a demanding ministry in another place
Our Lord communed with His Father and depended on the Spirit to minister through Him
Is your schedule demanding
Follow the example of Jesus and set aside a specific time for prayer
Then depend upon God's power to help you meet each day's demands.
As a young girl, Amy Carmichael wished she had blue eyes instead of brown
She even prayed that God would change her eye color and was disappointed when it didn't happen
At age 20, Amy sensed that the Lord was calling her to serve Him as a missionary
After serving in various places, she went to India
It was then that she realized God's wisdom in the way He had made her
She may have had a more difficult time gaining acceptance from the brown-eyed people if her eyes had been blue
She served God in India for 55 years
We don't know for sure that Amy was more readily accepted because of her eye color
But we do know and believe that it is the Lord 'who has made us, and not we ourselves'
As we submit to His wisdom in everything, we can serve Him effectively
Amy knew what submission was
When asked about missionary life, she replied, 'Missionary life is simply a chance to die.'
Jesus said, 'Whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it'
That describes the devoted Christian's life as well total surrender to God's plans and will for us
May we submit to Him today.
The ancient Israelites gathered at Gilgal for the coronation of Saul as their first king
The Lord was not pleased that His people had asked for a king, yet on this occasion Samuel uttered these words
'The Lord will not forsake His people, for His great name's sake, because it has pleased the Lord to make you His people'
We too are God's 'own special people'
if we have trusted Jesus as Savior
He will not forsake us even though He knows we will fail Him
He knows what we are like sinful, weak, and frail
He knew it before He called us and drew us to Himself
The certainty of our salvation rests not in ourselves but on the character of God
He will keep us to the end
This does not give us an excuse to continue in sin
Paul said, 'Certainly not
How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?'
Our choices do reflect on God's reputation, our witness in the world, and our fellowship with Him
But God will never reject His people, those who are truly His
The Lord cannot and will not forsake His own
We can rest assured
What God saves, He keeps for the sake of His great name!
During the 1920s and 30s, photographer August Sander set out to portray a cross-section of German society
Through his lens he saw factory workers and financiers, actresses and housewives, Nazis and Jews
Even though his published collection contains only people in and around his hometown of Cologne, he captured what David Propson, writing in The Wall Street Journal, called 'a universe of humanity in his restricted sphere.'
That phrase strikes me as an apt description of our lives and the people we meet day by day
Wherever we live, we cross paths with people from many backgrounds and beliefs
For years, the apostle Paul traveled and preached before being imprisoned in Rome
There he continued to touch people with the gospel because he cared about them and wanted them to know Jesus Christ
The book of Acts concludes with Paul confined in Rome, living under guard in a rented house, where he 'received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ'
Instead of focusing on his restrictions, Paul saw opportunities
That's the key for us as well
There is a universe of humanity within our reach today.
The bumper sticker 'Jesus is my co-pilot'
may be a well-intentioned sentiment, but it has always troubled me
Whenever I'm in the driver's seat of my life, the destination is nowhere good
Jesus is not meant to be just a spiritual 'co-pilot' giving directions every now and then
He is always meant to be in the driver's seat
We often say that Jesus died for us, which of course is true
But there's more to it than that
Because Jesus died on the cross, something inside of us died the power of sin
It's what Paul meant when he said, 'I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me'
We were essentially co-crucified with Him
With Jesus in the driver's seat, the old destinations are off-limits
No more turning down the streets of self-centeredness, greed, or lust
No more off-road ventures into the swamp of pride or the ditch of bitterness
We were crucified with Him and He is at the wheel now
He died so that He alone can drive and define us
So, if you've died and Christ lives in you, He's not your co-pilot
Your joy is to let Him drive and define your life
There may be a few bumps in the road, but you can count on it
He'll take you somewhere good.
Sports team names have a variety of origins
They come from history , nature , and even colors
One even comes from the mollusk family
In the 1980s, the University of California at Santa Cruz was just starting to get involved in competitive sports
UCSC had a bit of disdain for the overemphasis some big-time schools place on athletics
so the student body sought a team name that would reflect a somewhat different approach
They decided on the Banana Slug, a yellow, slimy, slow, shell-less mollusk
It was a clever way for UCSC to give a balanced perspective on the relative worth of sports
I have always loved sports
but I know that they can easily become more important than they should be
What matters most in life is what Jesus said is most vital loving God with all of our hearts and loving our neighbors as ourselves
Micah listed God's requirements this way: 'do justly,' 'love mercy,' and 'walk humbly with your God'
For believers in Jesus, it is vital that nothing else takes top priority over God's expectations for us
What matters most to you
The Spartans The Red Sox
Or loving God in thought, word, and action
It's been a long, cold winter
I am eager for warm weather
I'm tired of seeing bare trees and lifeless brown leaves covering the ground
I long to see wildflowers poke through the dead leaves and to watch the woods turn green once more
Yet even as I anticipate my favorite season, I hear my mother's voice saying, 'Don't wish your life away.'
If you're like me, you sometimes hear yourself saying, 'When such and such happens, then I will
or, If only so and so would do this, then I would do that
or, I would be happy if
or, I will be satisfied when
In longing for some future good, we forget that every day regardless of the weather or our circumstances is a gift from God to be used for His glory
According to author Ron Ash, 'We are where we need to be and learning what we need to learn
Stay the course because the things we experience today will lead us to where He needs us to be tomorrow.'
In every season, there is a reason to rejoice and an opportunity to do good
The challenge for each of us every day is to find something to rejoice about and some good to do and then to do both.
Living in Colorado, I climb mountains
On summer weekends, I see casual hikers who have no idea what they are doing
In sandals, shorts, and T-shirts, carrying a single container of water, they start up a trail at mid-morning
They have no map, no compass, and no rain gear
My neighbor, who volunteers for Alpine Rescue, has told me stories of tourists rescued from certain death after wandering off a trail
Regardless of the circumstances, Alpine Rescue always responds to a call for help
Not once have they lectured a hapless tourist, 'Well, since you ignored the rules of the wilderness, you'll just have to bear the consequences.'
Their mission is rescue
They pursue every needy hiker, no matter how undeserving
The central message of the Bible is one of rescue
Paul points out that none of us 'deserve' God's mercy and none of us can save ourselves
Like a stranded hiker, all we can do is call for help
Quoting the psalmist, he says, 'There is none righteous, no, not one; 
there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God'
The good news of the gospel is that in spite of our state, God seeks after us and responds to every plea for help
You might say that God is in the rescue business.
The name of a pretty Bavarian town in Germany shares the name of a place of horror Dachau
A museum on the grounds of this infamous Nazi concentration camp attracts many World War II history buffs
As you look around, it would be hard to miss the misleading words welded to an iron gate: Arbeit Macht Frei
This phrase Work Makes You Free was just a cruel lie to give false hope to those who entered this place of death
Many people today have false hope that they can earn a place in heaven by working at being good or by doing good things
God's standard of perfection, however, requires a totally sinless life
There's no way any of us can ever be 'good enough.'
It is only through the sacrifice of the sinless Savior that we are made righteous
God made Jesus 'who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
Eternal life is given because of God's gift of grace not because of our good works
Don't let Satan trick you by giving you false hope that your good works will save you
It is only through Jesus' work on the cross that you can have real freedom.
A woman in Oregon was caught driving 103 miles per hour with her 10-year-old grandson in the car
When she was stopped by the police, she told them that she was only trying to teach him never to drive that fast
I suppose she wanted him to do as she said, not as she did
The Pharisees and teachers of the law seemed to have a similar problem
Jesus had a scathing assessment of them: They were spiritually bankrupt
He held these two groups directly responsible for this sad spiritual condition
As the successors of the lawgiver Moses, they were responsible for expounding the law so that people would walk in God's ways and have a genuine and vibrant relationship with the Lord
But their personal interpretation and application of the law became more important than God's law
They did not practice what they preached
What they did observe was done not to bring glory to God but to honor themselves
Jesus exposed who they were image managers, posers, and hypocrites
The test of the effectiveness of following Jesus is not just in what we say but in how we live
Are we telling others God's Word and doing what it says
Let's model by words and actions what it means to follow Him.
People have some needs that are excruciatingly deep
Poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote, 'Never morning wore to evening, but some heart did break.'
We find ourselves in conversation at times with heartbroken friends and may feel at an utter loss to know what to say
How can we 'speak a word in season to him who is weary,'
as it says in Isaiah 50:4
Telling people what human teachers have taught us may have some impact on them
But the most helpful or persuasive words are spoken by those who are taught by the Lord Himself
That's why it's essential for us to sit at Jesus' feet and learn from Him
The more we receive from Him, the more we have to give to others
George MacDonald pictures this time with the Lord as having 'a chamber in God Himself.'
He continues: 'Out of [that] chamber
man has to bring revelation and strength for his brethren
This is that for which he was made.'
It's through our thoughtful and prayerful Bible study, reading, and quiet meditation that God speaks to our hearts
He gives us 'the tongue of the learned'
so that we have something to share with those who are in the depths of despair.
William Scoresby was a British seafaring explorer in the 19th century who responded to God's call to the ministry
An interest in the workings of navigational compasses stayed with him during his work as a clergyman
His research led to the discovery that all newly built iron ships had their own magnetic influence on compasses
This influence would change at sea for various reasons leading crews to read the compass incorrectly
Often this led to disaster
There is a striking parallel between the misread compass and false biblical teaching
In 1 Timothy 1, Paul warned against 'fables and endless genealogies'
man-made changes in the doctrines of God's Word
People who teach false doctrines 'have suffered shipwreck,' Paul concludes
Two people who opposed the Word of God by placing false teaching in its place, and who thus faced spiritual shipwreck, were Alexander and Hymenaeus
Biblical truth is being questioned and in some cases even replaced in the church today
Our opinions must never replace the truth of God's Word
The Bible, not man's erroneous opinions about it, is the ultimate guide for our conscience in navigating life's changing seas
Beware of wrong readings.
A young man told his father, 'Dad, I'm going to get married.'
'How do you know you're ready to get married, Ron?' asked the father
'Are you in love?'
'I sure am!' he replied
The father then asked, 'Ron, how do you know you're in love?'
'Last night as I was kissing my girlfriend goodnight, her dog bit me and I didn't feel the pain until I got home!'
Ron has got that loving feeling, but he has a lot of growing to do
Vernon Grounds, a former writer for Our Daily Bread, who has been married for more than 70 years
He shares these points about how to grow in love: Ponder God's love in Christ
Take time to reflect on how He gave His life for you
Read about Him in the Gospels, and thank Him
Pray for the love of God
Ask Him to give you an understanding of His love and to teach you how to live that out in your relationships with your spouse and others
Practice the love of God
Give of yourself
A newlywed told me he thinks love is practical
He said, 'My responsibility is to make life easier for my spouse.'
The other, tougher side of love is to challenge each other to act in godly ways
Love will grow when we ponder love, pray for love, and practice love.
It has been said that the Roman Empire ran on olive oil
It was used in cooking, bathing, medicine, ceremonies, lamps, and cosmetics
For decades, olive oil from southern Spain was shipped to Rome in large clay jugs called amphorae
Those jugs, not worth sending back, were discarded in a growing heap of broken shards known as Monte Testaccio
The fragments of an estimated 25 million amphorae created that man-made hill, which stands today on the bank of the Tiber River in Rome
In the ancient world, the value of those pots was not their beauty but their contents
Because of this, the first-century followers of Christ would have clearly understood Paul's illustration of the life of Jesus in every believer
'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
Our bodies, like amphorae, are temporary, fragile, and expendable
In our modern world that highly values outward beauty, we would be wise to remember that our greatest treasure is the life of Jesus within us
By God's grace and power, may we live so that others can see Christ in us
We are just the clay pots
Jesus is the true treasure within us.
With 4 years of seminary under my belt, I walked into my first ministry with a long agenda
As a new pastor, I thought I was there to change that place
Instead, God used that place to change me
The board members were supportive, but they relentlessly kept my feet to the fire in administrative details
I needed to learn how to work with lay leadership, how to be careful in my work, and how to dream with others
We often think God has assigned us to change the world around us when in reality He is interested in changing us
To make each of us 'a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work'
God often uses the most unlikely people in the most unlikely places to teach us some of life's most difficult lessons
And just when we think we've arrived, He is instructing us further
Not long ago I entered a new season of ministry
I may be a 'seasoned veteran,'
but I'm still learning, still growing, and still amazed at how God continues to shape this vessel for His noble purposes
If you want to be an agent of change, don't resist the true Agent of Change
He has your best interest and His at heart!
As I was giving myself a manicure, I started feeling sorry for my right hand
It does the most work, but my left hand gets the most attention
My right hand applies nail polish smoothly to my left-hand nails, 
but my left hand, lacking skill and coordination, does not return the favor
The polish on my right hand is always smeared and messy
One hand does the better work, but the other hand gets all the attention and honor
As I worked on my fingernails, my thoughts turned toward something much more important the people in my church
many of whom are highly skilled at tasks that make others look good
These hardworking folks, however, seldom get noticed, because their work puts the attention on someone else
It seems unfair that those who do such good work get little appreciation
Truly servant-minded believers, though, don't see it that way
They give preference to others because they know that God sees what others do not and that He will reward those whose work is unseen by others
Is someone else reaping the benefit of your hard work
Be encouraged
God rewards those who work 'invisibly'
to make Christ visible to the world.
Giraffes have the shortest sleep cycle of any mammal
They sleep only between 10 minutes and 2 hours in a 24-hour period and average just 1.9 hours of sleep per day
Seemingly always awake, the giraffe has nothing much in common with most humans in that regard
If we had so little sleep, it would probably mean we had some form of insomnia
But for giraffes, it's not a sleep disorder that keeps them awake
It's just the way God has made them
If you think 1.9 hours a day is not much sleep, consider this fact about the Creator of our tall animal friends
Our heavenly Father never sleeps
Describing God's continual concern for us, the psalmist declares, 'He who keeps you will not slumber'
In the context of this psalm, the writer makes it clear that God's sleepless vigilance is for our good
Verse 5 says, 'The Lord is your keeper.'
God keeps us, protects us, and cares for us with no need for refreshing
Our Protector is constantly seeking our good
As one song puts it: 'He never sleeps, He never slumbers
He watches me both night and day.'
Are you facing difficulties
Turn to the One who never sleeps
Each second of each day, let Him 'preserve your going out and your coming in'
It was a simple task, but I was in over my head
One of the items on the grocery list was soy
Problem was, I didn't know what kind of soy my wife, Sue, had in mind when she made the list
After searching the aisles and asking the advice of a worker who was stacking soup cans, I grabbed a bottle of soy sauce, placed it in the cart, and went on my way
Only after I unloaded my bags at home did I discover that Sue didn't want soy sauce She wanted soy milk for our granddaughter Eliana
I was sincere in my search
I even asked for help and confidently pulled my selection off the shelf
But it didn't do me any good
I had the wrong stuff
Sadly, some people are walking through the grocery store of life with 'heaven' on their list, but they are not getting what they need
Despite their sincerity and the intended help of others, they grab something that won't get them to heaven because they find a 'different gospel'
Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life
No one comes to the Father except through Me'
And Peter said, 'There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved'
Trust Jesus
Don't settle for the wrong gospel.
The Taj Mahal in India is a magnificent mausoleum
Built entirely of white marble, it was commissioned by the Emperor Shah Jehan in memory of his wife, who died suddenly
It took 22 years to complete
Millions of tourists visit this memorial annually in order to see this grand structure the emperor ordered to be built in memory of the woman he loved
Millions of people also throng to Jerusalem to look at another site
a tomb that some say may have been where Jesus was buried
No matter what tomb He lay in, Jesus occupied it for only a few days
It has been empty for 2,000 years
Jesus doesn't need us to build a memorial to Him
Instead, He gave us the Lord's Supper as a memorial to remember Him
On the night He was betrayed, Jesus took bread and the cup and gave thanks to His Father before offering them to His disciples
Each time we partake of those elements in church, we are first to examine ourselves and our relationship with God
'As often as [we] eat this bread and drink this cup'
we are to do so in remembrance of the One we love, till He comes
The Lord has given us an enduring memorial to remind us of what He has done for us.
Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament
Yet hidden away in its brief record is a vital question that affects us all
How should we respond when we see an enemy experience misfortune
The prophet Obadiah ministered during the time that the city of Jerusalem was under fierce attack by the armies of Babylon
The neighbors of Jerusalem, the Edomites, were actually cheering on the enemy armies to destroy and kill
Ironically, these hurtful jeers were spoken by blood relatives of the Jews
They were descendants of Jacob, and the Edomites were descendants of Esau
Obadiah condemned the Edomites for gloating: 'You should not have gazed on the day of your brother in the day of his captivity; nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction'
If someone has repeatedly been hurtful to us, it is easy to give in to vindictive pleasure when they experience misfortune
But Scripture admonishes us, 'Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles'
Instead, we are to maintain an attitude of compassion and forgiveness, and trust God to bring justice in His time.
Have you ever dreamed that you were falling out of bed or from some great height, and you awoke in fright
I remember that as a boy I would often be awakened by such a terrifying feeling
I heard about a man who had this sensation as soon as he slipped into sleep
He was so rudely awakened by his sense of falling that he was afraid to go back to sleep
He feared he would die, and he imagined he was falling into a bottomless pit
Then one evening as he was strolling through a cemetery, he saw this phrase engraved on a tombstone
Underneath Are The Everlasting Arms
These words reminded him that when believers die, they are safely carried by the Lord to their home in heaven
He recalled the assurance of the psalmist, 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me'
The once-fearful man realized that in life and in death and even in sleep the 'everlasting arms'
of our loving Lord are there to catch and hold us
That night he was able to sing what he was taught in childhood, 'Teach me to live that I may dread the grave as little as my bed!'
At last he could fall asleep without fear.
What a frustrating problem pollution is
Everybody suffers with it, yet everybody contributes to it
Pollution takes many forms, but one type is often overlooked
Charles Swindoll calls it 'verbal pollution,' passed around by grumblers, complainers, and criticizers
'The poison of pessimism,' Swindoll writes
'creates an atmosphere of wholesale negativism where nothing but the bad side of everything is emphasized.'
A group of Christian friends became concerned about this form of pollution and their personal part in it
So they made a pact to avoid critical words for a whole week
They were surprised to find how little they spoke
As they continued the experiment, they actually had to relearn conversation skills
In Ephesians 4, Paul called believers to 'put off' the old self and its conduct that grieves the Holy Spirit and 'put on' the new self that builds up others
As we rely on the help of the Spirit , we can make those changes in our conduct, our thinking, and our speaking
If we want to be rid of verbal pollution, we must choose to change and ask for God's help
It's a great way to start cleaning up our spiritual environment.
An anonymous author wrote, 'When I was first converted, and for some years afterward, the second coming of Christ was a thrilling idea, a blessed hope, a glorious promise, the theme of some of the most inspiring songs of the church
'Later it became an accepted tenet of faith, a cardinal doctrine, a kind of invisible trademark of my ministry
It was the favorite arena of my theological discussions, in the pulpit and in print
Now suddenly the second coming means something more to me
Paul called it '\sthe blessed hope.'
But today it appears as the only hope of the world.'
From the human standpoint, there is no solution for the struggles of the world
Leaders are naturally frustrated in trying to deal with the increasing problems in society
The only complete and permanent solution is found in the return of Christ to earth
When He comes, He will set up His kingdom
He will rule the nations in righteousness, and 'the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea'
As we await our Savior's return, let us keep on praying, working, and watching, while 'looking for the blessed hope' our only hope for this world.
In an evangelistic meeting in Ireland, the speaker was explaining what it means to abide in Christ and to trust Him completely in every trial
Concluding his message, he repeated several times, 'It means that in every circumstance you can keep on saying, '\sFor this I have Jesus.' '
The meeting was then opened for testimonies
One young woman said, 'Just a few minutes ago I was handed this telegram 
It reads, '\sMother is very ill; take train home immediately.' 
When I saw those words, I knew that tonight's message was meant just for me
My heart looked up and said, '\sFor this I have Jesus.' Instantly a peace and strength flooded my soul.'
Three or four weeks later the evangelist received a letter from this woman
'Thank you again for the message you gave that day
Life has become an uninterrupted psalm of victory, for I have come to realize that no matter what life brings, for this I have Jesus.'
That believer in Christ had found in her Savior the One who would be with her 'through fire and through water,'
and who would bring her 'out to rich fulfillment'
If you are enduring a great trial of affliction, remember for this you have Jesus!
Praise is powerful
When Scottish pastor Robert Murray McCheyne was troubled with a coldness of heart toward the things of the Lord, he would sing the praises of God until he felt revived in his spirit
Those in his household were often able to tell what hour he awoke because he began the day with a psalm of praise
One day, while he was trying to prepare his heart for preaching, he wrote in his journal: 'Is it the desire of my heart to be made altogether holy
Lord, You know all things
I've felt so much deadness and grief that I cannot grieve for this deadness
Toward evening I revived
Got a calm spirit through [singing psalms] and prayer.'
McCheyne had been uplifted by praising God
Perhaps you feel as if you are mired in what John Bunyan called the 'slough of despond.'
Lift a song of praise to the Lord
The psalmist said, 'I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever'
When we do that, the praise will flow not only from our lips but also from our heart
The Lord delights to give 'the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness'
Yes, 'it is good to sing praises to our God'?, at all times .
New York City
Easter Sunday, 7:30 a.m
I was the only customer at Jimmy's Diner in East Harlem when a man entered and approached my table
He said, 'Good morning, and God bless you,'
left a gospel tract, and quickly walked out
I smiled, appreciating his witness and realizing that God has His people everywhere
That night I attended church with our daughter Debbie, joining an enthusiastic congregation of 300 people, most in their twenties and thirties
Their infectious love for Christ and others was a bright light in a city that is often considered spiritually dark
In the first century, Paul visited the Greek city of Corinth, which was known for its immorality and corruption
When he faced opposition for presenting Jesus as Messiah, the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision
'Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city'
No matter where we go, the Lord's people are there
The risen Christ is powerfully present in and through all who know Him
The Lord has His people where you are today
Look for them and Join them
Christ is risen indeed!
After my doctor announced that I had cancer, I tried to listen to what he said, but I couldn't
I went home, pulled a blanket over my head, and fell asleep on the couch, as if sleeping could change the diagnosis
When I finally gained enough strength to tell my loved ones, my friend Judy Schreur said something especially memorable
After expressing her sympathy, she said, 'This is what will happen
You will feel really bad for 3 days
Then you will get up, figure out what you have to do, and get on with your life.'
Then she added, 'I think it has to do with death, burial, and resurrection.'
At the time, I didn't believe it
I was sure that life as I knew it was over
Nothing would ever be the same
I couldn't imagine feeling normal again
But she was right
Three days later I woke up and realized I didn't feel quite so bad
And little by little, despite the physical misery of chemotherapy treatments, my emotional and spiritual condition improved significantly
I 'died' to my old reality and was 'raised' to a new normal
Thankfully, God is in the business of resurrection
For those who have died in Christ, the death of one reality means resurrection to a new, glorious normal so that we can 'walk in newness of life'
In 1602, Italian artist Caravaggio produced a painting called The Taking of Christ
This work, an early example of the Baroque style, is compelling
Created in dark hues, it allows the viewer to contemplate Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane
Two main elements of the scene depicted in the painting demand the observer's attention
The first is Judas as he delivers the traitor's kiss
Immediately, however, the viewer's focus is drawn toward Jesus' hands, which are passively clasped together
It show that He offered no resistance to this injustice
Although He possessed the power to create a universe, Christ gave Himself up voluntarily to His captors and to the waiting cross
Long before this scene took place, Jesus told His listeners that no one could take His life from Him
He would lay it down willingly
This heart of voluntary surrender was prophesied by Isaiah, who wrote, 'He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth'
Christ's lamblike self-sacrifice is a grand indicator of His powerful love
'Greater love has no one than this,' He explained, 'than to lay down one's life for his friends'
Think of it
Jesus loved you that much!
Sometimes silence is the best response to a false charge
At other times we must speak up
When false witnesses accused Jesus as He stood before the Sanhedrin, He 'kept silent'
Defending Himself would have been useless
Furthermore, He was fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 53:7
But earlier in His ministry, Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, challenging them to prove that He sinned
A pastor resigned from his church because a few members made untrue statements about him
He thought it unchristian to defend himself, and in some instances it is
But in this case, the troublemakers needed to be confronted and their false charges refuted
He should have urged them to repent or face church discipline
Saying nothing may allow wrongdoers to go unchallenged in their evil ways
But if God's Spirit leads us to remain silent, or if we want merely to try to salvage our wounded pride, then we should hold our tongue
Are you being falsely accused
If you discern that it's futile to argue, or if your pride has been hurt, ask God for grace to say nothing
But if you feel concern for the wrongdoers and want to see justice done, speak up!
What started out as a collection has grown into a ministry opportunity for Larry and Mary Gerbens
For the past 10 years they've been collecting artistic works based on the story of the prodigal son from Luke 15
Their collection includes a painting by Rembrandt and a number of items by other artists depicting this story
The Gerbens wanted to share their collection, so they put it on display at a local college
Larry said, 'The artists have ministered to us, and we hope their work will minister to others.'
As I wandered through the displays, I was touched by the deep need of the prodigal, his honest repentance, and the beautiful forgiveness of the father portrayed in the variety of art pieces paintings, etchings, engravings, glasswork, sketches, and silk screens
We have all been like the son in this story, who had other plans for his life than what his father had for him
We have all run away from our heavenly Father
But He welcomes us when we come to Him
You too will see the beauty of forgiveness in your heavenly Father's face when you cry out to Him, 'Father, I have sinned
If you're away from Him, head home now and experience His love.
In 1977, 15-year-old Kevin Baugh and a teenage friend decided to create their own country, just for fun
The Republic of Molossia began as they drew a map, created paper money, and made a flag
Today, Mr Baugh continues his micro-nation the same way it began just for fun
When Chicago Tribune reporter Colleen Mastony toured his 1.3 acre kingdom in the Nevada desert, Baugh assured her he still pays US taxes, which he calls 'foreign aid.'
'It's always tongue-in-cheek,' Baugh admits
'I'm doing this for the pleasure and enjoyment of having my own country.'
Not many of us will create our own nation, but we all have a kingdom of the heart where we decide who will rule
The apostle Peter wrote: 'Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts'
'Sanctify' means to set apart Christ as Lord or Ruler of our life
There is something within each of us that longs to be in control of our lives
It may be only a small corner where we assert our spiritual independence and answer to no one but ourselves
But true freedom comes when we allow Christ to rule our hearts.
At RBC Ministries, our human resources team has developed an effective and encouraging program that centers around gratefulness
When an employee notices something good another employee does here at the office, he or she can take a special 'Thank You' card provided by human resources and write a note of appreciation
It's a good feeling to walk into your office and find one of those cards on your desk
Isn't it great to be thanked for a job well done
Doesn't a good, hearty 'thank you' brighten your day
And doesn't it make your relationships a little more special just to know that your work is not being taken for granted
Everybody loves to be thanked
Even God Our heavenly Father finds pleasure in our expression of thanks to Him
It's His will that we tell Him 'Thank You.'
'Give thanks in all circumstances,' Paul said
'for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus'
The writer of Hebrews took it a step further by saying, 'Let us be thankful, and so worship God'
Keep looking for ways to improve your relationship with God
Don't forget what may be the most basic way to worship and honor Him: Tell Him 'Thanks.'
For His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus chose a donkey to serve as His royal transportation
His disciples were instructed to say, 'The Lord has need of it'
Isn't it astounding that the Son of God should use such lowly means to accomplish His purposes
Alexander MacLaren commented on this: 'Christ comes to us in like fashion, and brushes aside all our convenient excuses
He says, '\sI want you, and that is enough.' '
Think of it
The Creator of the universe needs us and desires to fit us into His eternal design
Though all-powerful and not dependent on any creature, He has chosen to carry out His plans through lowly human instruments
If this were not so, He would have taken us to heaven as soon as He saved us by His grace
Someone once asked Francis of Assisi how he was able to accomplish so much
He replied, 'This may be why: The Lord looked down from heaven and said, '\sWhere can I find the weakest, littlest man on earth?' Then He saw me and said, '\sI've found him
I will work through him, and he won't be proud of it
He'll see that I am only using him because of his insignificance.' '
You may be small in your own eyes, but God has need of you!
Early in our marriage, I thought I knew the ultimate shortcut to my wife's heart
I arrived home one night with a bouquet of a dozen red roses behind my back
When I presented the flowers to Martie, she thanked me graciously, sniffed the flowers, and then took them into the kitchen
Not quite the response I had expected
It was an introductory lesson in the reality that flowers are not my wife's primary language of love
While she appreciated the gesture, she was mentally calculating the cost of an expensive bouquet of flowers a budget breaker for a young couple in seminary
And as I've discovered through the years, she is far more interested in my time and attention
When I devote myself to her in an uninterrupted and attentive way, that's when she really feels loved
Did you ever wonder how God wants us to show that we love Him
We get a clue when we read, 'He who loves God must love his brother also'
It's that simple
One of the primary ways we show our love for God is by loving our brothers and sisters in Christ
When we genuinely love each other, it brings pleasure to our heavenly Father
So watch for opportunities to tell Jesus that you love Him
He's infinitely worth whatever it costs.
Just before kickoff at Super Bowl XLIII, Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals received the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award a tribute given to the player who had best combined on-field excellence with off-field community service
'I am humbled the Lord has given me such an amazing life to impact others,' said Warner, a dedicated Christian
'Of all the awards given to NFL athletes, [this one] stands out because of what it represents.'
It represents a commitment to giving and sacrificing for others
Paying homage to those who serve is not a new concept
Paul spoke of it when he reminded the Philippians to honor those who gave themselves in serving Christ
He told them of their friend Epaphroditus, who had nearly died because of his efforts for Christ in ministering to others including the people at Philippi
How should they respond
Paul said, 'Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem'
Clearly, when we think of those who sacrifice in serving the Savior, they are worthy of our respect and appreciation
Why not look for ways to show gratitude to those who have served you spiritually
Give them the honor they deserve.
Having suffered greatly first from cancer, and then from the grueling medical regimen pastor Dan Cummings was tired
After 2 weeks of treatment in Texas, he was looking forward to going back home to Michigan
In a post on his blog, he wrote: 'Today is far better
amazing what some hydration will do
Will fly home on the weekend to continue treatment at home.'
Dan did return to Michigan
but several days later, his journey on earth ended
He went home to be with his God whom he loved with every bit of his weakened body but mighty spirit
When I viewed his blog a few days later, his words 'Today is far better' jumped out at me
I smiled through my tears in the knowledge that Dan was now experiencing a life that is truly 'far better'
Someday we who claim the name of Jesus will also go to that place where there is 'no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.'
It's a place where there is no more pain and where a loving Father promises to 'wipe away every tear from [our] eyes'
The life we have here isn't all there is
There is a far, far better place that Jesus is preparing for those who love Him .
When I used to teach at a Bible college in a large city, I sometimes graded papers at a food court while waiting for a commuter train
One day, I accidentally bumped my large cup of coffee
Its entire contents emptied into my open briefcase
In most cities, there is a quiet reserve on the part of commuters
However, the coffee splash was so dramatic that it could not be ignored
A man sitting nearby said aloud, 'Worst possible scenario!'
That comment was obviously an overstatement
But each of us dreads the thought of something in particular: financial loss, the death of a child or spouse, cancer, or another loss or hardship
The book of Job is a case study in worst possible scenarios
Yet Job wisely assessed God's role in trying circumstances of loss and poor health: 'He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold'
From this wise statement we can learn two valuable lessons: One is that what we dread most can be used to test our character and make us stronger
The other is that God will provide the strength and comfort to see us through
Cling to God
He has promised to work on our behalf, even in the worst possible scenario.
You can't see it, hear it, or touch it, but scent is powerful
The smell of things like crayons, petunias, and colognes evoke memories that transport me to the past and bring to mind people and places I might not otherwise recall
Some celebrities have fragrances named after them
Fans can identify with an actress or singer by dabbing on the scent bearing her name
Along those lines, Ladies Home Journal published a quiz to help readers determine the perfect fragrance for them
The idea is that every woman, to be memorable, should have a specific scent associated with her
The idea of a signature scent is not new
God introduced it as part of worship
In the tabernacle, a certain scent was to be associated with the Lord
The people were forbidden to use this fragrance for anything but worship
This idea continues under the new covenant, but with a stunning difference
Instead of using incense to make people think of Him, God uses Christians as His 'signature scent' to the world 
The fact that God identifies Himself with us in such a powerful way is a truly humbling thought, and causes me to ask, 'What do people think about God as a result of being around me?'
An article in The Washington Post told about a 15-year-old girl who sent and received 6,473 cell phone text messages in a single month
She says about her constant communication with friends, 'I would die without it.'
And she is not alone
Researchers say that US teens with cell phones average more than 2,200 text messages a month
To me, this ongoing digital conversation offers a remarkable illustration of what prayer could and should be like for every follower of Christ
Paul seemed to be constantly in an attitude of prayer for others: '[We] do not cease to pray for you'
'Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit'
'Pray without ceasing'
But how can we possibly do that
Missionary Frank Laubach described his habit of 'shooting'
prayers at people as he encountered them during the course of each day
In a sense, he was 'texting' God on their behalf, staying in constant communication with the Father
Laubach believed that prayer is the mightiest force in the world, and said: 'My part is to live in this hour in continuous inner conversation with God and in perfect responsiveness to His will.'
Pray without ceasing
Perhaps what Paul urged us to do can be done.
Recently it was discovered that some milk producers in China had been diluting cow's milk and adding the industrial chemical Melamine
This chemical was added because it artificially enhanced protein readings
Several infants died and others became seriously ill
Such adulteration is not new
Other countries have been adding Melamine to animal feed for at least 40 years for the same purpose, resulting in the death of animals
Another kind of adulteration is when people add to God's Word, 'the pure milk of the Word'
as Peter described it
The word pure means 'unadulterated'
or 'uncontaminated.'
The early church had to deal with those who considered circumcision necessary for salvation
That idea was rejected because it was not in accordance with the Word of God, which says that salvation is by grace alone
Peter encouraged his brethren in the Lord: 'Why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples
We believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved'
Examine carefully any teaching that asks you to do anything more than what is in God's Word
Otherwise it can be deadly to your spiritual well-being.
The movie The Princess Bride has a wedding scene in which the marrying minister says, 'Marriage is what brings us together today.'
Sometimes it is good to remind ourselves of the grand plan for marriage spelled out in Scripture
Marriage creates one new family out of two: Adam said, ' '\sThis is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
.' Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife'
It provides a pure outlet for a divinely designed desire
'Because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband'
It forms a mutually helpful team
'The heart of her husband safely trusts her
She does him good and not evil all the days of her life'
Marriage God's way brings a man and a woman together to honor Him and help society
Celebrate marriage for the ways it brings us together in God's name.
I often take a moment as I wait at our grocery store checkout stand to scan the covers of the magazines displayed there
It seems that if they aren't about sex and money, they're about diet, fitness, health, and outward beauty
There's nothing there for the soul
The problem is that people read the wrong magazines those that are full of lies that fixate on beauty of face and form as though that's all there is
This can lead to comparison and terrible despair
Some years ago, a friend of mine told of a conversation he had with a lovely, self-assured teenager
'You're very self-confident,' he observed
'Can you tell me why?'
'Yes,' the young woman answered
'It's because I'm so pretty.'
'Oh, I'm sorry,' he said with extraordinary wisdom
'Why?' she asked in surprise 
'Because,' he replied, 'you may not always be pretty.'
'Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing' is the wisdom we read in Proverbs 31
Physical beauty all too quickly fades away; all one's efforts to keep it are doomed to fail
But there is an inner beauty authentic beauty that will endure forever in the one 'who fears the Lord'
If someone were to ask, 'Who are you?'
my guess is that you would tell a little about yourself and what you do 'I'm an electrician'
or 'I'm a nurse.'
But that's not really who you are it's what you do
Which leads to the question, If what you do is who you are, who will you be when you stop doing what you're doing?
Who you are is found in your relationship to Jesus
And this sense of identity will drive your behavior
Take Matthew, for example
As a tax collector during the reign of the Roman Empire, his life was driven by greed
But everything changed the day Jesus showed up and invited Matthew to follow Him
Suddenly Matthew had a whole new identity as a follower of Christ
And he wasn't the only one
We also read about four fishermen in Matthew 4:18-25, Peter, Andrew, James, and John, who left their nets to follow Him
Jesus is a compelling Person, and He is still looking for followers
He wants to make something of your life by giving you the identity of a follower of Jesus
It doesn't mean giving up your career, but it does mean that you will do your work and all of life according to His will and ways
So next time someone asks, 'Who are you?'
I hope you'll answer, 'I'm a follower of Jesus'?!
When my brother-in-law was a missionary in Mali, West Africa, he was involved in a traffic accident
A man had wandered into the road in front of Chuck's motorcycle
The cycle struck the man and sent Chuck and the bike sliding along the ground for more than 200 feet
Shortly after Chuck regained consciousness in the hospital, his doctor told him he had been 'really lucky.'
Chuck smiled and replied, 'God is good.'
Later he thought about the day's events
The man who was struck hadn't received any permanent injuries, and Chuck would also recover from his injuries
But what if one of them had been killed
He thought, God would be no less good
When we experience tragedy, we may wonder about God's goodness
Is God always good
Yes, He is
He doesn't promise that bad things will never happen to us, but He does promise to be 'our refuge and strength'
He doesn't promise that we will never walk through heart-wrenching circumstances, but He promises that we won't be alone
God is good no matter what suffering we are experiencing
Even when we don't understand, we can say with Habakkuk, 'Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation'
Louis B Neumiller was known for his humility, integrity, and commitment to quality
As president of the Caterpillar Tractor Company from 1941-54, he led the manufacturer of earth-moving equipment through the challenges of World War II into global expansion
In the book In Their Time: The Greatest Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century, authors Mayo and Nohria describe Neumiller's leadership as 'success without fanfare.'
His mark of greatness, they note, was that he took his identity out of the business and 'let his company become a hero instead of himself.'
We see the same quality of selflessness in John the Baptist, the dynamic preacher who repeatedly affirmed his mission of paving the way for the Messiah
When John's followers became concerned that Jesus was baptizing people and crowds were following Him, John replied: 'You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, '\sI am not the Christ,' but, '\sI have been sent before Him.'
He must increase, but I must decrease'
As followers of Christ, are we lifting Him up instead of seeking honor for ourselves
Rather than being disappointed when our contribution is unnoticed, we should be glad because our highest privilege is to magnify the Lord
He's the hero
Honoring Him is the mark of greatness.
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of a battle that turned the tide of America's Civil War
One of the focal points of the conflict was a rocky knoll called Little Round Top where Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and the men of the 20th Maine Infantry stood their ground
Had the Confederate troops gotten past Chamberlain's men, some historians believe the Union army would have been surrounded, possibly leading to the loss of the war
The '20th Maine' was the last line of defense
Followers of Christ are also engaged in a vital war
As we battle 'the wiles of the devil'
we are called to wear the armor of God and to stand firm in the conflict
And like the Gettysburg soldiers, we have a 'last line of defense.'
For us, though, this defense is greater than any human force
In Romans 8:31-39, Paul says that our ultimate confidence is in the undying love of Christ
So complete is our protection that nothing can 'separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord'
When the enemy seems overwhelming and all seems lost, remember, we have an unbeatable last line of defense: 'We are more than conquerors through Him who loved us'
In Forever Young: My Friendship with John F Kennedy, Jr., Billy Noonan recalls the life experiences he shared with the son of President John Kennedy
In 1980, as one of the stories goes, John Jr and Billy were invited aboard the USS John F Kennedy aircraft carrier
On a guided tour of the ship, the two young men and their guide inadvertently entered a restricted area
When an officer stopped them, the guide pointed to John and said, 'This is his father's ship.'
Snapping to attention, the officer saluted John
He explained his understanding that when a US Navy ship is named for someone, it is considered that person's ship
Thus, as the son of the man for whom the ship was named, John Jr had unique privileges
This illustrates a vital spiritual principle
As adopted children in God's family, we who have been saved possess the position of sonship
Paul wrote that as believers we are 'predestined to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself'
By virtue of this sonship, we have the unique privileges that belong to the children of the King of kings
In life's challenging voyage, we can take courage that our 'Abba, Father' owns the ship and shares all with us
Praise God, we are joint-heirs with Christ!
Edwin van der Sar, goalkeeper for the Manchester United soccer team, had a 'safe' pair of hands
He kept the ball from entering his team's goal for 1,302 minutes, a world record in one season
That means that for almost 15 games of 90 minutes each, no one was able to score even one goal against his team while he was guarding the goalposts
But one goal by an opposing team in March 2009 ended his record
The psalmist David found comfort in the safest pair of hands God's hands
He wrote of God's protection in Psalm 138, 'You will stretch out Your hand and Your right hand will save me'
Like David, we can look to God's safe hands to keep us from spiritual danger and defeat
Another assurance from God's Word for followers of Christ is Jude 1:24-25: 'Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever Amen.'
That doesn't mean we'll never stumble
But it does mean we won't stumble so badly that God cannot pick us up
God's safe pair of hands can never fail ever!
The spotted owl has been disappearing in the US
Originally it was believed that old growth logging was its greatest threat
But research shows that one of the owl's relatives may be the problem
For the past 15 years, the barred owl has been rapidly migrating westward
Barred owls, which used to live exclusively east of the Mississippi, compete for the same food as spotted owls but are more aggressive and adaptable
In a similar way, our greatest spiritual conflict often comes not from outside the church, but from other Christians
This was happening in the church of Corinth
Paul took some time to address the divisive spirit that had grown in this congregation
This spirit threatened the unity of the church
Paul, with a pastoral nudge, encouraged the Corinthians to agree on the essentials and not be divided over the nonessentials
People were quarreling because they were aligning themselves with different Christian leaders Paul, Apollos, Peter, and even Christ
In creating these divisions, they were valuing their favorite leader above unity in Christ
Paul said the one essential that should unify the church is preaching the good news
That should be our united goal as well.
Less than the least of all God's mercies.'
This was the motto 17th-century English poet and clergyman George Herbert engraved on his signet ring
This motto was the phrase with which he signed his letters and books
Jacob had spoken these words when he pondered God's goodness despite his own sin and shame: 'I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant'
The word 'mercies' is from the Hebrew word chesed, meaning 'God's enduring love.'
I think it is significant that it rose from the heart of one who saw himself as utterly unworthy
Relying solely on God's faithful love, Jacob cries out: 'Deliver me!'
What an odd combination of thoughts: 'I am not worthy
Deliver me'
Unlike some who seem to have it all together, Jacob knew that everything he brought to God had been ruined by sin
He thought of himself as a man undeserving of God's grace
But his hope lay not in his worth but in the promise of God to look with favor on those who throw themselves on His mercy
Humility and contrition are the keys that open the heart of God
As He did with Jacob, God hears us when we humbly cry out to Him for mercy.
Jill Price has an extraordinary memory that has stunned scientists
In 2006, her overdeveloped memory was described in a scientific journal article, 'A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering.'
Price has no special aptitude for memorizing lists of words, numbers, facts, or languages
But she does remember what happened to her on any given day over the last 30 years
Name any date and Price will tell you what day of the week it was, the weather, what she had for breakfast, the TV programs she watched, and the people she spoke with
Few of us have a memory like that
That's why we need reminders to complete simple tasks and keep our appointments
This is especially true when it comes to spiritual truth
The apostle Peter showed he understood the need of spiritual reminders when he wrote: 'I will not be negligent to remind you always of these things
Yes, I think it is right
to stir you up by reminding you
Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things'
No matter what kind of memory we have, we need to be reminded of biblical principles
Daily Bible reading, small group studies, and involvement in a local church can all help us to remember God's vital truths.
One of my favorite Far Side cartoons is captioned 'Superman in his later years.'
It shows the elderly Man of Steel perched on a window ledge, ready to leap, as he looks back and says, 'Now where was I going?'
Forgetfulness happens to us all
while our occasional lapses may be amusing or annoying, a lack of memory toward God can be disastrous
With the people of Israel poised to enter the Promised Land, Moses challenged them to 'remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness'
and to 'beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments'
Forgetting God can spring from: Testing
God allowed His people to hunger and then provided manna
When we lack the necessities of life, it's easy to feel that God has somehow forgotten us
Abundance or need may produce spiritual amnesia because both cause us to focus on ourselves, not on God who provides
If prosperity brings a feeling of self-accomplishment, then we have forgotten God
Humility, obedience, and praise help us remember God's faithful provision and care
Let's not forget to thank Him today for all He's done.
Martie and I recently traveled to some major cities in several countries
We were struck with how lost our world is and grieved over the millions who have never heard the message of the saving grace of Jesus
The thought of reaching our world for Christ felt overwhelming
Until I remembered the story of the boy walking on a beach
Encountering hundreds of starfish dying under the heat of the burning sun, he started throwing them back into the sea
A passerby asked, 'What are you doing?'
'Saving their lives,' the boy replied
'Forget it,' the man said
'You can't possibly save all these starfish.'
'Right,' replied the boy, 'but it makes a big difference to each one I do save.'
I love the boy's perspective
When the wave of sin threw us onto the shore to die, God sent His Son to walk on the beach to rescue all who would repent
And, as Jesus told His listeners in Luke 15, each time someone is rescued, heaven throws a party
'I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance'
Has heaven rejoiced over your rescue
If so, join the ranks of those who reach other lost souls with the rescuing grace of Jesus.
I was having a conversation with some children about God and superheroes when Tobias asked a question
An imaginative, curious 5-year-old, he asked anyone listening: 'Does God have a sidekick like Hercules does?'
His wiser, older brother, age 7, quickly responded: 'Yes, He has thousands of them' they're His angels.'
Angels are a popular topic of discussion, and people believe a number of myths about them
For instance, some people pray to angels, thinking they are on the same level as God Himself
And some believe that people become angels when they die
But here's what the Bible, our authority, teaches: 'God created angels
'Angels worship God , and are known by these terms: archangels , cherubim , and seraphim
'They minister to God's people by guarding and protecting them
'They are given special assignments by God
'God's angels rejoice when we repent of sin and turn to Christ for salvation
Only God deserves our worship
So let's join the angels in singing His praises!
As the high school chorale prepared to sing Horatio G Spafford's classic hymn, 'It Is Well With My Soul,'
Spafford, a teenager stepped forward to tell the song's familiar history
Spafford wrote the song while on a ship that was near the spot at sea where his four daughters perished
As I listened to that introduction and then the words sung by the teenagers, a flood of emotions washed over me
'Where his four daughters perished'
were hard words to grasp as I listened again to Spafford's words of faith
Having lost one daughter suddenly, I find the idea of losing four unfathomable
How could it be 'well' for Spafford in his grief
I hear the words 'When peace like a river attendeth my way'
and remember where peace can be found
Paul says in Philippians 4 that it can be found as our heart-prayers are voiced to God
By trustful praying, we unburden our hearts, divest our anxieties, and release the grip on our grief
And we can gain 'the peace of God'
an inexplicable, divine calmness of spirit
This peace supersedes our ability to understand our circumstances , and it is a guard on our heart, through Jesus, 
This peace protects us enough to allow us to whisper, even in the pain, 'It is well with my soul.'
Our flight had been airborne about 15 minutes when the pilot announced that the aircraft had a serious problem the crew was trying to analyze
A few minutes later, he announced that it was a vibration and that we would have to return to the airport
Then the flight attendants made a series of step-by-step announcements explaining what was going on and what would happen once we were on the ground
In an event that could have been terrifying, the fears of the passengers were relieved because we were given the right information
In the first century, a group of believers in Thessalonica were afraid that their believing loved ones who had died were gone forever and would miss out on the second coming of Christ
For that reason, Paul wrote, 'I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope'
Paul's words of comfort were intended to soften their fears by giving them the right information, which made all the difference in the world
While grieving their loss, they could still have hope of a coming reunion with those who were in Christ
In seasons of loss, we too can find comfort and hope because the Bible has given us the right information.
After studying the effect of the post-World War II economic boom in Japan, Richard Easterlin concluded that monetary growth does not always bring more satisfaction
More recently, economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers conducted surveys in more than 100 nations and concluded that life satisfaction is highest in the richest countries
So who's right
Let's check with the writer of Ecclesiastes
He should know
He was a truly rich man
He had the means to try everything in this world and he did
He gave himself to pleasure , grand projects , entertainment , and hard work
But he concluded that it was all 'vanity and grasping for the wind
There was no profit under the sun'
Lasting satisfaction doesn't come from possessing tangible things like savings accounts and material goods
Recent events have shown that these things can suddenly lose value
To find true happiness, we have to find it in Someone who is not from 'under the sun.'
And that is our Savior, Jesus
Hymnwriter Floyd Hawkins wrote: 'I've discovered the way of gladness
I've discovered the way of joy
I've discovered relief from sadness
When I found Jesus, my Lord.'
Only He can give joy that is full .
When I was a young teenager, my dad, uncles, cousins, and I went trout fishing at the head waters of the Sacramento River in California
The source of the river is melted snow, so the water was swift, clear, cold, and refreshing
My cousins and I couldn't resist stepping into the cool current while angling for rainbow trout
On the way home, we stopped for a dip in a pond that was far different
The pond water was warm, and it smelled stagnant
It contrasted greatly with that swiftly flowing, invigorating stream
The prophet Amos used the metaphor of a stream to illustrate the transforming power of righteousness
Appalled at Israel's dead religious ritual and their exploitation of the poor , he called for justice and righteousness to prevail
He saw that God's people were stuck in the stagnant pond of injustice toward others when what they needed was a life marked by 'righteousness like a mighty stream.'
Likewise, God desires for us to allow justice to 'run down like water'
from our lives
One way that can happen is to strive for just laws and to champion loving care for the poor
May we seek to be a part of God's mighty stream of His righteousness until Christ returns.
Leslie and her two daughters were about to be evicted from their home
Although Leslie believed that God could help, so far He hadn't given a clue as to how
She wondered, Where is God
As she drove to the courthouse, she prayed for God's intervention
Then she heard a song on the radio proclaiming, 'God is here
Let the brokenhearted rejoice.'
Could this be the assurance from God that she was longing to hear
Inside the courtroom, Leslie stood before the judge, heard his decision, and signed the legal documents, but still God had not given her an answer
As Leslie was walking to her car, a truck pulled up beside her
'Ma'am,' said the driver
'I heard your testimony inside the courtroom, and I believe God wants me to help you.' And he did
Gary helped Leslie get in contact with a woman from a local church who was able to work with the parties involved to reverse the process so that she and her girls could stay in their home
When people ask, 'Where is God?'
the answer is, 'Right here.'
One way God is at work is through Christians like Gary who are continuing the work Jesus started healing the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds .
When I first became a Christian and started attending church at age 19, I immediately fell in love with singing the great hymns of the faith
My heart overflowed with joy and thanksgiving as we sang of God's love for us in Christ
Soon one of my favorite hymns became 'Fairest Lord Jesus!'
I love the simplicity of the melody and the awesomeness of the One exalted in these words: Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight, and all the twinkling starry host: Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer than all the angels heaven can boast
Beautiful Savior
Lord of the nations
Son of God and Son of Man
Glory and honor, praise, adoration now and forevermore be Thine
God's Son, whom we sing about in this song, came to this earth, lived a perfect life, and gave Himself for us on the cross
He arose from the grave and is now seated at God's right hand
One day we'll join in worship with thousands upon thousands and say: 'Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!'
Maybe we'll sing 'Fairest Lord Jesus!' too
Until then, let's allow Jesus to be 'the fairest' above all in our personal lives by seeking wisdom from His Word and following in His ways.
In the book Another Country, author Mary Pipher met with people in their seventies, eighties, and nineties who were confronting many different life situations
'I wanted to understand the country of old age,' Pipher writes
'We are not organized in a way that makes aging easy.'
The root problem, she observed, is that young and old have become segregated, to the detriment of both groups
This social trend is not necessarily intentional
But many people do ignore and shirk their responsibilities for the elderly
In Jesus' day, the Pharisees found creative ways to avoid their family duties
In Mark 7:9-13, Jesus rebuked their common practice of dedicating their material possessions to God rather than using their assets to provide for their parents
Their tradition had violated the commandment to honor their father and their mother
Our children, work, and church activities can pull us in many directions
But that doesn't excuse us from honoring our aging parents by making provision for their needs, as much as we are able
When the time comes for us to enter the country of old age, let's hope we've set the right example for our own children to follow.
No one wants to be weak, so we find ways to appear strong
Some of us use the force of our emotions to manipulate people
Others use the force of personality to control people, and some use intellect to intimidate
Although these create an illusion of strength, they are signs of weakness
When we are truly strong, we have the courage to admit our limitations and to acknowledge our dependence on God
As a result, true strength often looks a lot like weakness
When the apostle Paul prayed that an affliction would be taken from him, God answered, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness'
Paul responded with these troubling words: 'When I am weak, then I am strong'
Toward the end of Jesus' earthly ministry, some of His disciples were striving for positions of prominence
Jesus used their argument as an opportunity to teach them that in His kingdom things are different: greatness comes when we willingly assume positions of weakness
This is a hard truth
I prefer the illusion of strength to the reality of weakness
But God wants us to realize that true strength comes when we stop trying to control people and start serving them instead.
Herman Wouk's thrilling World War II novel The Caine Mutiny contains an excellent illustration of what happens when someone becomes a follower of God
In the novel, a young man from an influential family has enlisted in the Navy
On the day of his induction, his mother drops him off in her fancy car and then kisses him goodbye
He shakes hands with the guard as he enters the building, and the door closes behind him
His mother, suddenly worried that he might not have enough money, rushes up to the door
But the guard politely stops her
When she demands entrance, he refuses to let her in
She can see her son standing inside the door, so she reaches for the doorknob
'He's my son!' she cries
The guard gently removes her hand from the knob and says softly, 'I know, Ma'am, but he belongs to Uncle Sam now
He's a sailor.'
When we believe in Jesus Christ and become His followers, we are under new authority
We are subject to new commands
Now we belong to Him
What was once important to us loses its significance
We evaluate things differently
Our new desire is to love and serve the Lord with all our heart
Have you joined His ranks?
My friends and I were anticipating a contemplative time looking at a collection of artwork about the prodigal son who returned home to a forgiving father
When we arrived at the information table, we noticed the brochures, books, and a sign pointing to the artwork
Also on the table was a dinner plate with bread, a napkin, and a glass
Each of us privately pondered what the significance of the plate could be
We wondered if it represented communion fellowship between the prodigal son and his father when he returned home
But as we examined it more closely, we realized simultaneously: Someone had left a dirty plate on the display table
And it wasn't bread, but leftover cookie bars
Our imaginations had been wrong
We had a good laugh
but then it made me think about how sometimes we imagine more than what's really there while reading the Bible
Rather than assuming that our speculation is correct, however, we need to be sure our interpretation fits with the whole of Scripture
Peter said that 'no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation'
As we depend on the Spirit's instruction, a careful study of the context, and the wisdom of respected Bible teachers, we'll avoid seeing things in the Word that aren't really there.
An antique dealer thought the wrinkled old baseball card she found might be worth $10
After posting it on eBay, she began to wonder if it might be more valuable than she had thought
She removed the posting and consulted a professional evaluator who confirmed that the photo on the 1869 card showed the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first professional baseball team in the US
The card sold for more than $75,000
Mike Osegueda's article in The Fresno Bee said that even though the card was creased and discolored, the most important thing was its authenticity it was real
Paul and his companions suffered greatly while spreading the gospel
In 2 Corinthians 6, he listed their outward trials, their inward traits, and their spiritual resources
Try to imagine the circumstances in which all these things interacted, beatings, patience, prison, kindness, distresses, love
Although broken physically, depleted emotionally, and tested spiritually, the authenticity of their faith in Christ clearly shone through
'As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things'
In our walk with Christ, there's no substitute for spiritual authenticity being real.
During a trip to the Far East, I visited an unusual shrine made up of hundreds of statues
According to our guide, worshipers would pick the statue that looked the most like an ancestor and pray to it
A few years ago, I read about a student named Le Thai
An ancestor worshiper, he found great comfort in praying to his deceased grandmother
Because he was praying to someone he knew and loved, he found this to be personal and intimate
But when he came from Vietnam to the US to study, Le Thai was introduced to Christianity that sounded like a fairy tale based on American thinking
To him, it was the worship of a foreign God
Then a Christian friend invited him to visit his home on Christmas
He saw a Christian family in action and heard again the story of Jesus
Le Thai listened
He read John 3 about being 'born again' and asked questions
He began to feel the pull of the Holy Spirit
Finally, he realized that Christianity was true
He trusted Jesus as his personal Savior
When friends see Christianity as foreign worship, we need to respect their heritage
At the same time, we share the gospel graciously and giving them time to explore Christianity
And then trust the Spirit to do His work.
I served in the Armed Forces many years ago and have always been thankful that I was able to give those years to my country
I must say, however, that my most memorable time in the service was the brief interval when I was a 'short-timer.'
Short-timers are soldiers who have but a few weeks before discharge
They spend their last days 'mustering out' visiting the commissary and the quartermaster's office to clear accounts and return equipment
What I remember most about that period was my jaunty pace and the happy, carefree spirit with which I carried out my tasks, I had duties but few worries, for I knew I was going home
Now that I'm an 'old-timer,' once again I'm a short-timer
It won't be long before I'm discharged from my duty here
Again, my pace is jaunty and my spirit is light for I know that very soon I'll be going home
That's the outlook that Jesus and His apostles called 'hope'
Hope, in the biblical sense, means certainty and assurance
It is the firm, unshakable, indomitable belief that we will be raised from the dead and will be welcomed into our eternal home
That's enough to put joy in our heart and a spring in our step this day!
One of the most difficult experiences in my years as a pastor was telling a member of our church that her husband, her son, and her father-in-law had all drowned in a boating accident
I knew the news would shatter her life
In the days following their tragic loss, I was amazed as she and her family responded with unusual faith
Sure, there was deep brokenness, haunting doubt, and confusion
But when nothing else made sense, they still had Jesus
Rather than deserting Him in the midst of their desperately difficult days, they ran to Him as the only source of hope and confidence
This reminds me of the reaction of the disciples to Jesus
After some of them 'went back and walked with Him no more' because He was hard to understand , Jesus turned to His inner circle, and asked, 'Do you also want to go away?'
Peter got it right when he responded, 'Lord, to whom shall we go
You have the words of eternal life'
Whatever you face today, be encouraged by the words of Peter and by the example of a family who went through the fire with their faith intact
As long as you're running in the right direction to Jesus you'll find the grace and strength you will need.
Parking my car has been a lifelong problem for me
It really wasn't a high priority with my driving instructor, so I never learned to back up into a parking space until many years later
He also skipped the parallel parking lesson, and I still avoid that unless there's enough space for two or three cars
I've also struggled to understand a statement I heard when I was a young Christian
'God can't steer a parked car.'
I took that as a challenge to shift my life into motion
Along the way God would guide me in the right direction
It's an interesting thought, but it's not always the way God works
Occasionally, God does want us to 'stay parked' for a while
At times, when Moses was in the wilderness, God kept the Israelites in one place
He led them by a cloud
when it stayed still for many days, 'the children of Israel did not journey'
Waiting isn't always easy, but sometimes God wants us to stay right where He has put us
The psalmist reminds us, 'Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart'
You may feel that you're stuck and just spinning your wheels in your service for God
But keep your heart open to God's leading
Then you'll be ready to shift gears when you hear God say, 'Let's go this way.'?
February 19, 1942, was a fascinating day for Canada
It was 'If Day'? a World War II staging of a fake Nazi invasion of Winnipeg, Manitoba
The intent was to show what it would be like 'if' Canada fell under the harsh occupation of Nazi forces, and so that Canadians would support the war effort more fully
As one person described the event: 'If Day brought home the reality of Nazi occupation
Manitobans got a very bitter taste of nearly every aspect of Nazi brutality.'
The key word there is nearly
While 'If Day' was a valiant attempt to educate people about danger in the world, it could not begin to recreate the actual suffering that was sweeping Europe
Real trials in life are not ifs, they are whens
In fact, life's most profound lessons cannot simply be observed, they must be experienced
It is there, in actual seasons of heartache and loss, that we gain greater insights into life, faith, and our need of God
To that end, James wrote, 'My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience'
Trials come because we live in a broken world, but we decide if we will learn the lessons taught
There are no 'ifs' about it
it is an important way to grow.
A clerk who helped me purchase a small digital voice recorder 
He told me that he kept one just like it in his car when he worked in California
'When I began driving home after work I switched it on,' he said, 
and I talked about everything that happened that day on the job, good and bad
When I pulled into my driveway, I hit the erase button.
Then he smiled
After telling everything to his voice recorder, he apparently had no need to go over the day's problems with his wife or family
He told us to turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, forgive offenses, reject greed, tolerate each other's weaknesses, live to serve and love one another as He has loved us
It seems that in large part, peace is up to us
Paul verifies that in Romans 12:18, 'As much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.'
This Christmas, let's make peace our gift to the world in which we live as we reflect the Prince of Peace.
If your physician called you and in a serious voice said, 'Please come in as soon as you can
I have something to discuss with you,'
you would know he has bad news
Your first response might be, 'No, I don't want to know.'
But you go because it is only when you know the diagnosis that you can learn the cure
God, our Great Physician, also has some bad news about man's spiritual condition
When against His expressed warning Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, God told Adam that all mankind would die spiritually and physically
That's the bad news
But He also gave the solution
He promised a Savior
The apostle John tells us, 'Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ'
But how does that help
Jesus came that first Christmas to bring God's grace, something that none of us deserve
because like Adam we have all sinned
But Jesus also came to reverse what sin brought
He came to be the truth that would bring us back to God
He came to 'save His people from their sins'
Listen to what the Great Physician has to say in the Bible about your spiritual condition
Then accept the cure He has provided the gift of salvation through Christ.
My son and his wife have a 120- pound American bulldog
This dog has a powerful body and fearsome face
Yet until we became friends, 'Buddy' wasn't sure he could trust me
As long as I was on my feet, he'd keep his distance and wouldn't look me in the eye
Then one day I learned that if I'd get down on the ground, the mood of Buddy's big-jowled face would change
Sensing I was no longer a threat, he'd playfully come running like a freight train, pounce on me with his big feet, and want me to scratch his muscular neck
Maybe what Buddy needed from me is a glimmer of what our God gave us by coming down to our level and living among us in the person of Christ
From the day that our first parents sinned and hid from the presence of the Lord, our tendency has been to be afraid of coming to a high and holy God on His terms
So, as Isaiah predicted, God showed how low He was willing to go to bring us to Himself
By adopting the form of a lowly servant, our Creator lived and died to disarm our wrongs
Even now He is coaxing us from the cover of our spiritual darkness to call us friends
How can we still be afraid to trust Him?
Every so often I catch myself wondering about the whole grand scheme of faith
I stand in an airport, for example, watching important-looking people in business suits, briefcases clutched to their sides, as they pause at an espresso bar before scurrying off to another concourse
Do any of them ever think about God, I wonder
Christians share an odd belief in parallel universes
One universe consists of glass and steel and wool clothes and leather briefcases and the smell of freshly ground coffee
The other consists of angels and spiritual forces and somewhere-out-there places called heaven and hell
We palpably inhabit the material world; it takes faith to consider oneself a citizen of the other, invisible world
Christmas turns the tables and hints at the struggle involved when the Lord of both worlds descends to live by the rules of the one
In Bethlehem, the two worlds came together, realigned
What Jesus went on to accomplish on planet Earth made it possible for God someday to resolve all disharmonies in both worlds
No wonder a choir of angels broke out in spontaneous song, disturbing not only a few shepherds but the entire universe .
Throughout history, Mary the mother of Jesus has been held in high esteem
And rightly so
She was singled out by God to deliver the long-awaited Messiah
But before we get lost in the significance of her life, let's take a look at what it meant for her to surrender to the assignment
Living in a small backwater Galilean village where everyone knew everyone else's business, she would have to live with the perceived shame of her premarital pregnancy
Explaining to her mother the visits of the angel and the Holy Spirit probably didn't calm things down
To say nothing of the devastating interruption that her pregnancy would bring to her plans to marry Joseph
And while we are thinking about Joseph, what would she tell him
Would he believe her
In light of these personal ramifications, her response to the angel who told her the news about her role as Jesus' mother is amazing: 'Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word'
Her words remind us that a life of significance is most often preceded by a heart eager to surrender to God's will regardless of the cost
What significant experience does God have in store for you
It starts with surrender to Him.
Newgrange is a 5,000-year-old burial passage tomb in Ireland
Built by the members of a farming community in Ireland's Boyne Valley, this magnificent structure covers more than an acre of land
It was a place where people went to struggle with the issue of death
It is best known for the beam of sunlight that moves through the chamber for 17 minutes each day from December 19 to 23 during the winter solstice, the shortest days of the year
Some say it serves as a powerful symbol of the victory of life over death
Ever since death entered the human experience in Genesis 3, it has been life's one great inevitability, and many people's chief fear
It need not be so, however
The apostle Paul wrote, 'For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ'
From that moment in the Garden of Eden with the sin of our first parents, sin and death reigned
Yet we need not fear death or its consequences
Because of Christ, we can have confident hope, His victory of life over death has given us eternal life
Have you received Him?
Have you heard of the 'Christocentric Principle' of biblical understanding
Simply put, it means that everything we know about God, angels, Satan, human hopes, and the whole universe is best understood when viewed in relationship to Jesus Christ
He is at the center
Recently, I discovered that one of the less familiar Old Testament books, Zechariah, is one of the most Christocentric
This book is a good example because it speaks of Christ's humanity , His humility , His betrayal , His deity , His crucifixion , His return , and His future reign
One especially meaningful passage is Zechariah 12:10, which says, 'Then they will look on Me whom they pierced.'
The piercing refers to Israel's historic rejection of Jesus as Messiah resulting in His crucifixion
But this verse also predicts a future generation of Jews who will accept Him as their Messiah
At the second coming of Jesus, a remnant of Israel will recognize the crucified One and turn to Him in faith
This marvelous book should encourage us to look for more Christ-centered truths, both in other parts of the Bible and in all of life
Keep Jesus in the middle of everything
Live a Christocentric life.
During a devotional session at a conference, our leader asked us to read aloud 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, and substitute the word 'Jesus' for 'love.'
It seemed so natural to say, 'Jesus suffers long and is kind; 
Jesus does not envy
Jesus does not parade Himself, is not puffed up
Jesus does not behave rudely, does not seek His own
Jesus never fails
Then our leader said, 'Read the passage aloud and say your name instead of Jesus.'
We laughed nervously at the suggestion
'I want you to begin now,' the leader said
Quietly, haltingly I said the words that felt so untrue: 'David does not seek his own
David is not provoked, thinks no evil
David does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 
David bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things
David never fails.'
The exercise caused me to ask, 'How am I hindering God from expressing His love through me?'
Do I think that other expressions of faith are more important
Paul declared that from God's perspective, eloquent speech, deep spiritual understanding, lavish generosity, and self-sacrifice are worthless when not accompanied by love
God longs to express His great heart of love for others through us
Will we allow Him to do it?
Leonard Ravenhill , a British evangelist, once said, 'The greatest miracle God can do today is take an unholy man out of an unholy world, make that man holy, then put him back into that unholy world and keep him holy in it.'
This seems to be what God did to Isaiah when He called him to speak to His people
Around the time of the death of Uzziah, one of Judah's more successful kings, Isaiah had a vision of God
The prophet saw Him as the true King of the universe, sitting on a lofty throne
In the vision, Isaiah saw seraphim worshiping God with a hymn that praised His holiness, majesty, and glory
Isaiah's vision of God led to a true vision of himself as unholy and broken before God
'Woe is me, for I am undone!', Isaiah said
This recognition of sin led him to a need for and the reception of God's cleansing grace
Newly cleansed, Isaiah was commissioned to spread God's message
The Lord sent Isaiah into an unholy world, not only to live a holy life but also to tell an unholy people about a holy God
The Lord wants to show Himself to us
Thus giving us a truer vision of ourselves, a deeper need for His grace, and a greater commitment to live and speak for Him
What a miracle!
During a talk-show interview, a celebrity confessed that she spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours each year on her hair and its styling
She recognized that it had become an addiction and admitted that her problem was 'submission to the hair.'
The word submission means 'an act of yielding to the authority or control of another.'
Because of her desire to look and feel beautiful, this celebrity was allowing her hair to be in control of her life
This woman's story could lead us to wonder about our own hearts' desires and what we're submitting to
Do we at times want something so badly that we submit to doing anything to get it
Are we submitting to admiration
Possessions, Self, Food, Money, Pleasure
In his epistle to the Romans, Paul said, 'to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves'
When our desires 'war' within us , we are to submit ourselves to God as 'slaves of God'
Humbling ourselves before the Lord and asking Him to show us our heart will help us to recognize our own submission problems.
A story is told about a family that went on a picnic by a lake
At one point, their 5-year-old son waded into the lake, stepped into deep water, and sank out of sight
None of the adults in the family knew how to swim, so they ran up and down the shore in panic while the child bobbed up and down and screamed for help
Just then, a man happened by who sized up the situation, leaped into the lake, and rescued the boy
He climbed out on the bank with the child, who was frightened but unharmed, only to hear the mother ask with irritation, 'Where's Johnny's cap?'
So often we focus on small disappointments that cause us to grumble and complain rather than focusing on the wonderful things God has brought into our lives, not the least of which is His everlasting love and eternal salvation
When we complain about the small dissatisfactions of life, we're asking, in effect, 'Where's Johnny's cap?'
Paul wrote, 'In everything give thanks'
We may not be thankful for everything that comes our way, but we can give thanks in everything
It may be difficult to be grateful when we lose our job or our health fails, but we can be thankful for the good that God has brought to us in this life and grateful for the life to come.
The Nobel Prize is awarded annually to people in a variety of fields who have made an extraordinary impact
Leaders in economics, physics, literature, medicine, and peace are recognized for their contributions
When a person is acknowledged with a Nobel Prize, it is the ultimate affirmation of years of training, effort, education, and sacrifice in pursuit of excellence investments that are the source of their impact
We might wish to make a significant impact spiritually in our world, but we wonder, What is the source of spiritual and ministry influence
If we want to make an extraordinary impact for Jesus Christ, what must we invest in
Christ's first followers were impacted from spending time with Jesus
Israel's religious leaders recognized this
Acts 4:13 tells us, 'When [the leaders] saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled
And they realized that they had been with Jesus.'
Training and education are valuable in the service of the Savior, but nothing can replace time spent in His presence
He is the source of whatever spiritual impact we might have on our world
How much time have you been spending with Jesus, your source of impact?
After our plane landed on the gravel airstrip, Jay and I climbed out and entered the world of Masai Mara in Kenya
A Masai tribesman named Sammy met us and loaded our baggage into a Land Rover
Then we headed toward the camp where we would spend the next 2 days
Stopping so we could watch the zebras and wildebeests migrating from Masai Mara to Serengeti, Sammy explained that the two massive herds travel together because the zebras have good eyesight but a poor sense of smell, and the wildebeests have bad eyesight but a good sense of smell
By traveling together, both are less vulnerable to predators
This was our first lesson from God's revelation in creation, which Kenya has in abundance
Just as God makes animals with different strengths and weaknesses, He makes people the same way
God made us to be dependent not only on Him but also on one another
The apostle Paul elaborated on this idea in his letter to the church in Corinth
As members of the body of Christ, we all have different gifts and abilities
The church is healthy only when we work together, look out for each other, and use our strengths to benefit one another.
When I was a freshman in Bible college, I began to be bolder about speaking up for the Lord
Not surprisingly, my new habit created friction with some
Attending a social event with my former high school friends bore this out
One young woman to whom I had witnessed earlier laughed at my concern about where she would spend eternity
Ed, a friend who knew of my faith, said jokingly, 'Three cheers for the old rugged cross!'
I felt put down and rejected
But later that evening I was filled with an unexplainable love
Recalling our Lord's command to 'Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you'
I prayed for Ed who had mocked the cross of Christ
With my eyes filled with tears, I asked the Lord to save him
About a year later, I got a letter from Ed saying he wanted to get together
When we finally met, he shared how he had wept over his own sinfulness and had invited Jesus Christ to be his Savior and Lord
Later, to my surprise I heard that Ed had become a missionary to Brazil
The lesson I learned from that experience is that prayer is the best response to spiritual opposition
What critic of your faith might need your prayers today?
Any fool can start a quarrel
'The name of the wicked will rot'
'He who hates correction is stupid'
Is it right for God's Word to call people fools, wicked, and stupid
Isn't God all about love and kindness
Indeed, God is love
God is kindness
He created a world with great possibilities for joy and contentment
Yet God reminds us that in His love He does not overlook the foolishness of our hearts and actions
Those verses from Proverbs can remind us that while God is love, He has great expectations for us
Life is tougher than it needs to be for those who bring self-imposed trouble upon themselves
Each negative word in those proverbs has a counterpart an alternative that gives God's preferred way to live
A fool quarrels, but the honorable man avoids strife
The name of the wicked rots, but the memory of the righteous is blessed
The stupid reject correction, but those who love instruction also love knowledge
There's always a choice in this life
Live God's way and enjoy His smile of approval or live as a fool and find destruction
That's the tough and tender truth about living in God's world
Which do you choose?
Wrinkled noses and puckered lips sometimes this is my family's reaction to my cooking, especially when I'm trying something new in the kitchen
Recently, I had a breakthrough with a unique version of macaroni and cheese
I jotted down the ingredients and tucked the recipe away for future reference
Without that set of instructions, I knew the next batch would be a flop
Without God's instructions, Joshua would have failed at leading the Israelites into the Promised Land
The first step was to 'be strong and of good courage'
Next, he was to continually meditate on the Book of the Law, and finally, he was to do everything it said
As long as Joshua followed the directions, God promised him 'good success'
God's 'recipe for success' can work for us too, but His idea of success has little to do with money, popularity, or even good health
In the original Hebrew, 'then you will have good success' means 'then you will act wisely.'
Just as God called Joshua to walk in wisdom, He wants us to 'walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise'
As we take courage in the Lord, feast on His Word, and obey Him, we have a recipe for godly success that's better than anything we could cook up on our own.
Dwight L Moody said, 'When a man thinks he has got a good deal of strength, and is self-confident, you may look for his downfall
It may be years before it comes to light, but it is already commenced.'
This was true of King Uzziah
Everything seemed to be going so well in his life
He was obedient, submitted to spiritual mentorship, and sought God's guidance during most of his reign
As long as he asked God for help, God gave him great success evidenced by his many accomplishments
Uzziah's life was one of great power and human success until he became blinded by it
His pride was evidenced in several ways: he challenged God's holiness by trespassing the temple and presuming upon a position he would never be able to have ; he viewed God's power as good but not absolutely necessary for his leadership ; he refused godly correction and counsel ; he bypassed his opportunity to repent; and he ignored, instead of feared, the consequences of his sin
When God gives us success in any area of our lives, let's not forget the Source of our success
May we choose humility, for God gives grace to the humble.
A medical school program in New York gives students who are training for geriatric medicine a unique opportunity
They experience life as nursing home residents for 10 days
They learn some of the struggles of maneuvering a wheelchair and being raised out of bed with a lift, as well as reaching the shower bar from a seated position
One student learned how little things counted for a lot like lowering nameplates on doors so that patients can find their rooms more easily, or putting the TV remote in a reachable location
Although the students still can't fully relate, they will be better able to serve the elderly in their future work
Sometimes God gives us the opportunity to use the lessons we've learned and the comfort He's given us during difficult times to help others in special ways
Paul indicated this when he wrote: 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble'
Are you using the lessons you've learned in your trials to touch the lives of others
Remember even little things can mean a lot.
The United States Secret Service was founded in 1865
Their mission to deal with counterfeiters in an attempt to protect the dollar and, as a result, America's national economy
This targeted group of law enforcement officers, however, experienced a change of direction in 1902
They became best known for protecting the President of the United States, although their charge still embodies a variety of tasks
That change of direction in the Secret Service duties is nothing compared to the completely altered lives of the believers at Thessalonica
They had a spiritual transformation that turned their lives around, which was noticed by people far and wide
Paul wrote, 'You turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God'
And 'you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe Your faith toward God has gone out'
The change of direction they displayed was dramatic
abandoning the worship of idols to embrace relationship with the true and living God
And people noticed the difference in their lives
I wonder do people recognize such a profound change in our hearts and lives
When our children were young, we observed Advent by making a wreath and lighting candles each night after supper
We sang a carol and read a short Bible passage about the birth of Christ
This was a special time of preparing our hearts to celebrate Christmas
But Advent is more than that
When Christians first started practicing it in the fourth century, they viewed it not only as preparation for celebrating Jesus' birth but also as a time of looking forward to His second coming
They found hope and cheer in the sure promise of His return
The gospel of Luke describes 'the glory of the Lord' that shone around the shepherds when the angel announced the Savior's birth
Luke also records Jesus' promise that He will return 'with power and great glory'
These two events frame the purpose for which the Son of God came into the world
In Latin advent means 'a coming.'
The weeks before Christmas can be a wonderful season of repentance and expectation as we celebrate our Lord's first advent in Bethlehem and anticipate His second advent when He returns in glory
Christ has come
Christ is coming again!
My grandfathers were both gardeners and so are many of my friends
I love visiting beautiful gardens they inspire me to make me want to create something equally beautiful in my own yard
But I have trouble moving from the inspiration to the perspiration part of gardening
My great ideas don't become reality because I don't spend the time and energy to make them happen
This can be true in our spiritual lives as well
We can listen to the testimonies of other people and marvel at the work God is doing in their lives
We can hear uplifting music and great preaching and feel inspired to follow God more diligently
But soon after we walk out of church, we have trouble finding the time or making the effort to follow through
James described such Christians as being like those who look in a mirror, see themselves, but do nothing to fix what is wrong
They hear the Word, but it doesn't lead to action
James says we need to do not just hear
When we move from the inspiration of simply 'hearing' about the good being done by others to the perspiration of actually 'doing' good works ourselves, the implanted Word of God will bloom into a beautiful garden of spiritual fruit.
Displayed on the wall of my friends' lake house is a collection of pictures
Each one of the photos is of a sunset, taken from their deck during various seasons
While each is strikingly beautiful no two are identical
When I look at them, it reminds me of what another friend once called 
He called a sunset God's beautiful signature at the end of a day
God writes His signature on each sunset and on each of His unique children as well
I never grow tired of discovering how every person I meet is so delightfully different
God is infinitely creative
The variety in our personalities, senses of humor, abilities, and preferences in music and sports are all handcrafted by Him
In the body of Christ, we see how a diversity of spiritual gifts still have a common bond and can work together for God's purposes to bring Him glory
In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, we read, 'There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit
There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord
And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all.'
God's signature that is so evident in nature is also present in His people
Let's celebrate the differences that make each of His children unique.
What do you find most refreshing
A cold drink on a hot day
An afternoon nap
Listening to praise and worship music
The biblical theme of refreshing has a variety of physical and spiritual meanings
In Scripture we read of refreshment by resting on the Sabbath , with cool water after physical activity , by soothing music , and with encouraging fellowship
The apostle Peter describes a time of spiritual refreshment that took place on the Day of Pentecost
He exhorted his listeners to repent and respond to the gospel 'that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord'
The apostle's statement was especially meaningful to the Jewish audience with its reference to the millennium when Messiah would rule
But the good news of spiritual life would also be extended to the Gentiles
Even now as believers we can experience a time of refreshing by quieting our hearts in a devotional time of prayer and Bible reading
When we spend time alone with the Lord, we can experience His peace and joy which renew us in spirit
Aren't you thankful for these daily times of spiritual refreshment?
Have you ever heard skeptics say that the Christian faith is nothing more than a crutch that the only reason people claim to trust Jesus is that they are weaklings who have to make up 'religion' to get by
Apparently those skeptics haven't heard about the doctor in one Far Eastern country who spent 2 years in jail being 'reeducated' because he professed faith in Christ
Then, after his release, he was arrested again this time for his efforts at his church
And perhaps those skeptics haven't heard about Paul
After trusting Christ, he was arrested, flogged, mocked, and shipwrecked
These believers were not looking for a crutch
No, they had something deep and essential in their hearts
They had a personal relationship with God a relationship born of faith in the work of Jesus on the cross
As a result, they became children of the King eager to sacrifice everything for the privilege of proclaiming Him
They were not limping along looking for something to hold them up
A crutch
Hardly
Faith in Christ is not about safety and caution
It's about believing Jesus and trusting Him no matter what
It's about taking up a daily cross and living for the Savior.
Not many years ago, we watched as the 'WWJD' craze swept through the Christian community
The bracelet-emblazoned theme 'What Would Jesus Do?'
was a valuable reminder to many people that we should consider the heart and mind of Jesus when making choices
As we seek to live in a way that honors the Savior, it is appropriate to measure our attitudes and decisions against the example our Lord set for us
Recently, however, I was in a church where I saw a slightly different message
This church's sign read, 'WDJD' What Did Jesus Do?'
That is indeed the more important question, because our salvation depends on it
Paramount among the remarkable deeds of the Son of God are the events described in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 'For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.'
What did Jesus do
He took the suffering and guilt for our wrongdoing and paid our penalty
He died and conquered death so we could live
And the fact is, we will never be able to fully consider what Jesus would do until we have embraced what He did do for us on the cross.
If you have a tendency to despair over lost opportunities or if you worry about the future, ask yourself this question: 'What is right in front of me?'
In other words, what circumstances and relationships are currently available to you
This question can get your focus off a past regret or a scary future and back to what God can do in your life
It's similar to the question God asked Moses at the burning bush
Moses was troubled
Aware of his own weaknesses, he expressed fear about the Lord's call for him to lead Israel out of bondage
So God simply asked Moses, 'What is that in your hand?'
The Lord shifted Moses' attention away from his anxiety about the future and suggested he notice what was right in front of him a shepherd's rod
God showed Moses that He could use this ordinary staff to perform miracles as a sign for unbelieving people
As Moses' trust in God grew, so did the magnitude of miracles God worked through His servant
Do you think about past failures too much
Do you have fearful thoughts about the future
Recall God's question: 'What is that in your hand?'
What current circumstances and relationships can God use for your benefit and His glory
Entrust them and your life to Him.
People love to collect things from baseball cards to stamps to coins
And while collecting can be a fun hobby, it is sobering to think that once we leave this earth, everything we own becomes part of someone else's collection
What value would it be to have collected much on earth but little or nothing for eternity
Jesus had something to say about this
Speaking to His disciples, He said: 'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal'
Eternal treasures never lose their worth
They can never be spoiled or stolen
And just think we can actually stockpile them
Through acts of service
Through leading others to Jesus
By being compassionate to those in need
By living according to the will and ways of Jesus
In the gospel of Mark, we read that the Lord tested the rich young ruler's heart when He asked him to sell all that he had, give it to the poor, and follow Him
The ruler's response revealed what he really valued
It's easy to become enamored with earthside stuff
but when you make the choice to follow Jesus, He'll show you the joy of collecting eternal treasures
Nothing on earth can compare!
On September 30, 2009, columnist Mitch Albom sat on stage at the Fox Theater in Detroit, Michigan, to interview Ernie Harwell, one of the most beloved men in American sports
Harwell spent more than 50 years as a radio play-by-play announcer, mostly for the Detroit Tigers baseball team
His kindness, humility, and warmth as a broadcaster left an indelible impression on all who met him
When Albom interviewed him, Ernie was 91 years old and had just announced that he had incurable cancer
But as Ernie talked, he wasn't about to let people feel sorry for him
Instead, he wanted to talk about the night in 1961 when he trusted Jesus Christ as Savior
And, during one of the final times this Hall of Fame announcer would be able to speak publicly, he concluded, 'I don't know how many days I've got left
[but] I can really know
whose arms I'm going to end up in, and what a great, great thing heaven is going to be.'
Ernie was anticipating something special
He knew that God had a glorious eternal home prepared for him , so he could look death in the face and praise God
Is that your confidence
Do you know that His arms are waiting to welcome you home
At the end, that's really all that matters.
We tend to compartmentalize our lives
We fill our days with activities such as work, errands, chores, caring for children
And then we try to carve out time for 'spiritual' activities such as church, small groups, personal devotions
I don't see that separation in the Psalms
Somehow David and the other poets managed to make God the gravitational center of their lives so that everything was related to God
To them, worship was the central activity in life, not something to get through so other activities could be resumed
The process of letting God in on every detail of life is one we need
For me, the Psalms have become a step in the process of recognizing God's true place at the center
The psalmists have an urgency, a desire, and a hunger for God that makes my own look anemic by contrast
They panted for God with their tongues hanging out, as an exhausted deer pants for water
They lay awake at night dreaming of 'the beauty of the Lord'
They would rather spend one day in God's presence than a thousand years elsewhere
It was 'the advanced school of faith' that these poets were enrolled in
Maybe as we read the Psalms, some of it will rub off on us.
Anna Anderson's husband died early in their marriage
He leaves her with three young daughters and a difficult future
Although trained in Virginia as a teacher, she lacked full credentials to work in the Philadelphia schools
So she took in laundry, did ironing, and later scrubbed floors at a large department store
As African-Americans, they often experienced racial prejudice and discrimination
When doors of opportunity closed, Anna believed that if they would trust the Lord with all their heart and acknowledge Him in all their ways, He would direct their paths
She taught her daughters to depend on God, follow Him, and always be thankful
When her firstborn, Marian, rose to become an internationally acclaimed classical singer, Anna continued to pray for her, and always gave God credit for her success
Reporters, who asked Anna how she felt after attending Marian's concerts at Carnegie Hall and her 1955 debut with the Metropolitan Opera, heard her say, 'We thank the Lord.'
Her reply was not a cliche, but sincere gratefulness to God
Rather than lament what she lacked, Anna Anderson expressed gratitude for what she had and used it for God's glory
Today, we can follow her example with faith, confidence, and a heartfelt, 'We thank the Lord.'?
As I looked at family members gathered around the Thanksgiving table, I smiled at the range of talents represented
At one end were doctors; at the other end were musicians
Thanks to doctors, human bodies operate more efficiently
Thanks to musicians, beautiful sounds uplift our spirits and soothe troubled minds
Although their abilities are very different, doctors and musicians rely on the same thing: an orderly universe
Without order, there would be no predictability; without predictability, there would be no music or medicine
Within our orderly world, disease is a sign that something is 'out of order.'
Healing is a sign that God will some day restore all things to their original condition
When John the Baptist wanted to know whether Jesus was the 'Coming One,'
Jesus said, 'Go and tell John
the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them'
Healing was evidence that Jesus was Israel's Messiah
I am thankful for music that soothes my troubled mind and soul, and for medicine that heals my body
This two things remind me of the ultimate healing and restoration that Christ is accomplishing.
Last November, news sources said that a shocking breach of security occurred when a couple brazenly walked into a White House state dinner even getting close enough to have their picture taken with the President of the United States
Usually, extensive background checks and careful scrutiny of the guest list screens out the uninvited
It's a rare day for any of us that our access is not restricted in some way
Signs warn us: Employees Only, Do Not Enter, Authorized Vehicles Only, No Trespassing
None of us want to be told that we are not welcome
But the fact is that there will always be some places from which we will be barred
It makes me grateful that God sets no restriction on who may come to Him
Those who come to God encounter no 'Keep Out' signs
Through prayer, God the Father allows us immediate and unlimited access to Him
It is because His Son Jesus Christ has opened the way to all who receive Him
'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden'
'The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out'
'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink'
Once you come to Christ for salvation, you can enjoy unrestricted fellowship
The door is always open.
I was feeling down about some circumstances the other day and wondering how I might lift my spirits
I pulled from my shelf the book Life Is Like Licking Honey Off a Thorn by Susan Lenzkes
I read this: 'We take the laughter and the tears however they come, and let our God of reality make sense of it all.'
Lenzkes says some people are optimists who 'camp in pleasures and good memories,' denying the brokenness
Others are pessimists who 'focus on life's losses, losing joy and victory in the process.'
But people of faith are realists who 'receive it all, all the good and bad of life and repeatedly choose to know that God really loves us and is constantly at work for our good and His glory.'
As I read, I looked outside and noticed dark clouds and a steady rain
A little later, a friendly wind came up and blew the clouds away
Suddenly the skies were bright blue
The storms of life blow in and out like that
By faith we cling to God's promise of Romans 8:28
And we recall that 'our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory'
God loves us, and He's getting us ready for the day when skies will be forever blue.
Psalm 8 begins with a startling contrast
David seems to suggest that while God has revealed His glory in the skies, another persuasive answer to His critics comes in the utterances of a child: 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger'
Why is a child's praise so persuasive
For one thing, it's because, unlike the impersonal universe, a child can know and love God
Jesus quoted Psalm 8:2 when religious leaders were scandalized that children were running around in the temple shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!'
These little ones knew as those leaders did not know, that Jesus was the long-awaited Son of God
Some of my most memorable moments as a parent came when I knelt beside our children's beds at night, and they opened their hearts to God
The simplicity of their love and trust as they prayed touched me deeply, dispelled my doubts and fears, and drew me to faith
We must never take lightly little ones who believe in Christ
Their witness is great, as is the witness in the skies.
After a 4-year-old got into trouble at preschool, his mom asked him what he had done wrong
He explained, 'I was angry with a playmate
But you told me that I should not hit anyone, so I asked my friend to do it for me!'
Where does someone so young learn that
The Bible tells us he did not have to be taught he was born with it
It is part of the fallen nature that all of us have at birth
But the Christian does not have to respond according to his fallen nature
Paul reminds us that 'our old man was crucified with [Christ],
that we should no longer be slaves of sin'
We are 'a new creation' and have been set free and have become 'slaves of God'
Yet, as Christians we do still struggle with our flesh and its sinful desires
But now that 'we are alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord,' we can respond in a God-honoring way
Instead of being like the young boy who tried to get revenge, we can obey the instructions of Romans 6:13, 'Do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as instruments of righteousness.'
My wife, Martie, and I have grown to love England, its history, culture, and people
One of our favorite activities when we visit is going to outdoor concerts on the sloping lawns of ancient estates
'The Last Night of the Proms' event is the best, with fireworks and hundreds of nationals waving little British flags to rousing patriotic tunes
We loved joining the celebration until the summer our children came with us
When we started waving our flags with all the enthusiastic Brits, our kids were aghast
I can still hear them shouting over the music, 'What are you doing?
You're Americans!'
God must often feel like that when we blend in and live like the 'locals' around us
I can almost hear Him saying, 'What are you doing living like that?
You belong to My nation!'
Peter reminds us that we are different from the locals we are a 'holy nation'
Being holy means that we are unique, set apart for Jesus, becoming like Him, and reflecting His countercultural ways of living
It means that we are forgiving in the face of cruel offenses; and merciful, gracious, truthful, and loyal to our promises
It means being just like Him
So let's start waving the flag of holiness as members of the 'Jesus nation'
In many countries, childhood obesity is at an all-time high
A major culprit in such unhealthy weight gain is poor eating habits and junk food
The term junk food refers to items that taste good but lack nutritional value and are often very high in calories and fat
Chips, soft drinks, candy bars, cookies, and many meals purchased at fast-food restaurants fit these criteria
To be spiritually healthy, we have to avoid 'spiritual junk food' as well
Some religious teachers proclaim 'a different gospel' , ranging from health-and-wealth to a counterfeit spirituality
And some Christian music and books also contain false teaching
Taking in this kind of 'food' may seem to satisfy spiritual hunger, but it will not lead to spiritual health
Hebrews warns us: 'Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines
For it is good that the heart be established by grace'
False teaching is detrimental to our health and is not profitable, because it cannot cleanse from sin nor give power for spiritual growth
But biblical content that is based upon grace and truth does both
Avoid 'spiritual junk food' and instead feast on God's Word to promote your spiritual health.
When we wash our hands to clean off the grime and germs, do we actually clean them ourselves
No and yes
To be precise, the soap and water does the job not us
But we make the choice to use the soap and water to clean our hands
In 2 Timothy 2, the apostle Paul tells us, 'Therefore if anyone cleanses himself he will be a vessel for honor'
This does not mean that we on our own have the power to cleanse ourselves from sin
Rather, we use the cleansing provided by Jesus Christ, who died for us on the cross
Philippians 3:9 tells us that we are 'found in Him, not having [our] own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith.'
When we receive Christ, His death and resurrection sets us free from the penalty and the power of sin
This enable us to say no and yes in everyday life
We can say no to the desires of the flesh, or 'youthful lusts' that Paul mentioned
And we can say yes to 'righteousness' , 'faith' , 'love' , and 'peace'
As we're cleansed daily, we'll be 'useful for the Master, prepared for every good work'
Internationally acclaimed violinist Midori believes that focused, diligent practice is the key to performance
While playing a rigorous schedule of 90 concerts a year, she still practices an average of 5 or 6 hours a day
Jane Ammeson, in NWA WorldTraveler magazine, quoted Midori as saying: 'I have to practice for my job and I practice every day
It's not really the hours, but the quality of the work that needs to be done
I see with students, that they play and they call it practice, but they are not listening and not watching
If you have your textbook open, it doesn't mean that you are studying.'
That same principle applies to our walk of faith
Paul wrote to Timothy, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth'
Diligence implies constant, earnest effort, and is the opposite of a careless, inattentive approach
It embraces every aspect of our relationship with God
Just as a musician strives for excellence, we should want to serve God with confidence, seek His approval, and skillfully share His Word with others
Am I diligently studying, praying, and listening to the Lord today?
Two young men with mischief on their minds approached a missionary's outreach bus parked in a downtown area of a German city
The missionaries were there to offer refreshments as a way to open up conversations about Christ
The two visitors, wearing skull-and-crossbones bandannas, were there to offer trouble
But the missionaries didn't respond to the ruffians as they expected
The Christians welcomed them warmly and engaged them in discussion
Surprised, the guys hung around long enough to hear the gospel
One trusted Jesus that day
The other, the next day
Those two young men and the missionaries who reached them were light-years apart culturally
The guys were German; the missionaries, American
The guys were involved in a culture of darkness and death; the missionaries were shining the light
The cultural divide was crossed with cookies and nonjudgmental love
Look at the people around you
How can you show those on the other side of the cultural fence unconditional, unquestioning love
How can you cross the divide and help them see that Jesus' love knows no boundaries
Cross the divide
Take Christ to the culture even if it doesn't look anything like yours.
As my wife and I were walking through a shopping mall, we came to a T-shirt stand
While browsing the shirts and their often humorous sayings, I noticed one with a disturbing message
It read, 'So Many Christians, So Few Lions.'
That shirt, with its reference to the first-century practice of throwing Christians to the lions in the Coliseum in Rome, wasn't at all funny
Persecution is no laughing matter
Not long before those brave Christians faced death in Rome's cruel sport, Paul wrote, 'All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution'
Persecution is inevitable, and it should be a matter of serious concern for all believers
In fact, at this very moment fellow brothers and sisters in Christ around the world are suffering in Jesus' name
What can we do about it
First, we can pray that God will comfort them in their suffering
Second, we can aid families left without support when loved ones are imprisoned
Third, we can pray now for courage should we face persecution
When the apostle Paul was put in jail for his faith, his courage led others to be bolder in their witness
Want to encourage the persecuted church
Pray, and then proclaim the message for which believers suffer.
An old TV sitcom featured an estab- lishment that the patrons seemed to frequent on a daily basis
The concept was that it was a welcoming place where 'everybody knows your name.'
We all want to be accepted, to fit in somewhere
But some people live on the margins of life where it can be difficult to feel they have any value or significance, or that they matter to anyone
Children sometimes experience this: Too tall when other kids haven't had a growth spurt yet
Too fat when the other kids are thinner
Too smart when their classmates are struggling
Or 'not smart enough' in comparison with others
Being different as a child can result in being mocked or bullied
But an adult who doesn't fit into the mold may just be ignored so insignificant that he or she feels invisible
But what a great significance we have in God's eyes
We were so valued that He sent His Son to pay the price for our sins and to allow us to have a relationship with Him
We were created in the image of God , and He has designed us and been involved in every detail of our life since before we were born
Whether or not we always feel significant, we are deeply loved by our Father.
Seventeenth-century Quaker leader Isaac Pennington said, 'The Lord has been teaching me to live upon Himself' not from anything received from Him, but upon the life itself.'
The people in John 6 wanted to live off Jesus, but not for the same reason
It was not because their hearts were loyal to Him, but because their hearts were loyal to what they thought He could provide for them namely, food and deliverance from Roman oppression
Jesus' provision of the loaves and fish was a confirmation in their minds of what He could do for them
Jesus knew that behind their interest in Him was their hope that He would become a different kind of king
so He withdrew from them
The next day they looked for Him and found Him, making their quest successful
So they continued to follow Him because of what they thought He could provide
But Jesus turned the tables and identified Himself as the Bread of Life
They wanted a better life from Him, but He told them He came to offer them eternal life
Only those who believe in Jesus can find true fulfillment now and forever
Follow Jesus, not just because He can provide 'the loaves,' but because He can satisfy your deepest hunger, the quest for eternal fellowship with Him.
On December 4, 2006, a 19-year- old soldier serving in Iraq saw a grenade being thrown from a rooftop
Manning the machine gun in the turret of his Humvee, he tried to deflect the explosive
but it fell inside his vehicle
He had time to jump to safety
Instead, he threw his body over the grenade in a stunningly selfless act that saved the lives of four fellow soldiers
This almost unexplainable act of self-sacrifice may help us understand why the Bible tells us that there is a kind of love that is more honorable than having great knowledge or faith
This kind of love can be hard to find leading the apostle Paul to lament that more people care for themselves than for the interests of Christ
That's why he was so grateful for Epaphroditus, a co-worker who 'came close to death, not regarding his life' in order to serve others
If we think we could never put our own life on the line for others, Epaphroditus shows us the first step with his selfless example
Such love is neither normal nor common, and it doesn't come from us
It comes from the Spirit of God, who can give us the desire and ability to feel for others some of the inexpressible affection God has for us.
Several years ago, I was driving down the freeway when my car died
I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car, and opened the hood
As I looked at the engine I thought, A lot of good this does me
I know nothing about cars
I don't even know where to start
That's how we might sometimes feel about prayer: Where do I start
That's what the disciples wanted to know when they asked Jesus, 'Teach us to pray'
The best place to look for instruction is in the example and teaching of Jesus
Two questions you may have are: Where should we pray
Jesus prayed in the temple, in the wilderness , in quiet places , in the Garden of Gethsemane , and on the cross
He prayed alone and with others
Look at His life, follow His example, and pray wherever you are
What should we pray
In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus taught us to ask that God's name be honored and that His will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Ask Him for your daily provisions, for forgiveness of sin, and for deliverance from temptation and evil
So if you're looking for a good place to start, follow the example of the Lord's Prayer.
In her book Food in Medieval Times,  author Melitta Adamson writes of European culinary delights in the Middle Ages
Wild game, pastries, puddings, and other exotic foods illustrate the creative joy taken in food preparation
But with all these wonderful entrees there was a problem overeating
This tendency was compounded by the Christian calendar, which abounded with fasts and feasts
Abstaining from meals was often followed by gluttony
To address this problem, theologian Thomas Aquinas uplifted the Christian character quality of temperance, calling it 'a special virtue.'
He saw how self-restraint should extend to all areas of life
For the believer, temperance, or moderation, does not derive from sheer human willpower
Instead, it comes from the Holy Spirit who gives us self-control: 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control'
Self-control is the Spirit-produced quality that enables us to be 'temperate in all things'
Overindulgence in food, rest, work, recreation, ministry, and a variety of 'good things' can be corrected only through the balance of self-control
Take a few minutes to ask God to produce that special virtue in you.
When my daughter and her family were in town for a visit, I had a chance to take my son and two sons-in-law out for a 'guy' outing
We decided that while the ladies were shopping, we would go to a firing range and practice shooting
We rented two pistols and took aim at our targets
While shooting, all four of us discovered that on one of the firearms the sight was set too low
If we aimed using that sight, we hit the bottom of the target
We had to aim high in order to hit anywhere near the bull's-eye
Isn't life a lot like that
If we set our sights too low, we really don't accomplish all that we can
Sometimes we have to aim high in order to reach a desired goal
What should be our aim in life
How high should we point our ambitions
Well, since Scripture is our true guide, we will shoot for nothing but spiritual maturity
In fact, in Paul's farewell to the people of Corinth, he said, 'Aim for perfection'
And we also have the high aim of these words from the lips of Jesus, 'You shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect'
Perfection is a lofty target, and we won't attain it in this life
But if we want to honor God and get close to that high goal, we need to aim high.
I love reading church slogans
You know, the ones you see on the marquee in front of churches
Recently I noticed a slogan that said, 'Come in and experience the presence of God.'
That one caught my attention, primarily because it's an important promise to make and sometimes a hard promise to keep
Hard, because if we're not careful our churches might reflect the presence of its people more than the presence of our God
So what would a church have to do to display the presence of God
Its people would have to live like Him
Dynamics like hospitality, the loving acceptance of all kinds of people, a quickness to serve, a tangible love for one another that makes people feel safe and included regardless of color or class, and a patient tolerance of one another's weaknesses
all be a great way to start
Paul said we should walk in a manner 'worthy of the Lord'
And he also said that being worthy means that we will be humble, gentle, bearing with one another in love, eagerly maintaining the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
Let's live in such a way that others will experience the presence of the God who lives in us, wherever we are, but especially at church.
Several years ago a friend took me to a motivational seminar that I thoroughly enjoyed
Instead of focusing on money and success, the leaders guided us toward understanding our unique identity and purpose in life
Then they passed along some helpful methods for effective living
One motto has stayed with me: 'Do it now!'
The principle they taught us was that it takes as much energy to avoid a task as it does to do it
Procrastination saps power; completion gives relief
A spiritual application can be seen in Hebrews 3, a passage filled with an air of immediacy as it calls us to obey the Lord
Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
but exhort one another daily, while it is called '\sToday,' lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin'
We don't know how long it would have taken the children of Israel to reach the Promised Land if they had obeyed God
their 40-year journey resulted from their unwilling hearts
An entire generation missed the adventure of a lifetime
When we know how the Lord wants us to live, why don't we just say 'Yes!'
No debate, no delay
Do it now!
Caerleon is a Welsh village with deep historical roots
It was one of three sites in the United Kingdom where Roman legions were posted during Rome's occupation of Britain
While the military presence ended some 1,500 years ago, the imprint of that occupation can still be seen today
People come from all over the world to visit the military fort, the barracks, and the amphitheatre that are reminders of the days when Rome ruled the world and occupied Wales
It amazes me that 15 centuries later, the evidence of Rome's presence can still so clearly be seen in that small community
I wonder, though, about another kind of imprint, the imprint of Christ on our lives
Do we allow His presence to be clearly seen by others
Is it possible for people who interact with us to know that Jesus occupies our lives
Jesus calls us to make known His presence in our lives to the glory of God the Father
He says, 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven'
Through the light of our testimony and the impact of our deeds of service, people should be able to see evidence of the presence of God in our lives
Is it true
Can they see His imprint?
John is a humble, uneducated man
Yet God used him to start the peace process in Mozambique
His name is not mentioned in any official documents; all he did was arrange a meeting between two of his acquaintances Kenyan Ambassador Bethuel Kiplagat and a Mozambican
But that introduction set in motion the events that led to a peace treaty after a 10-year civil war
From that experience, Ambassador Kiplagat learned the importance of respecting everyone
'You never dismiss people because they are not educated, because they are white, because they are black, because they are women, because they are old or young
Every encounter is sacred, and we need to value that encounter,' the ambassador said
'You never know what word might be there for you.'
The Bible confirms that this is true
Naaman was a great man in Syria when he got the dreaded disease of leprosy
A servant girl whom he had captured from Israel told Naaman's wife that the prophet Elisha could heal him
Because Naaman was willing to listen to this lowly servant girl, his life was spared and he came to know the one true God
God often speaks through those to whom few are willing to listen
To hear God, be sure to listen to the humble.
Actor Christopher Reeve was para- lyzed in a horseback riding accident in 1995
Prior to this tragedy, he had played the part of a paraplegic in a movie
In preparation, Reeve visited a rehabilitation facility
He recalled: 'Every time I left that rehab center, I said, '\sThank God that's not me.'
After his accident, Reeve regretted that statement: 'I was so setting myself apart from those people who were suffering without realizing that in a second that could be me.'
And sadly, for him, it was
We too may look at the troubles of others and think that it could never happen to us
Especially if our life journey has led to a measure of success, financial security, and family harmony
In a moment of vanity and self-sufficiency, King David admitted to falling into the trap of feeling invulnerable: 'Now in my prosperity I said, '\sI shall never be moved''
But David quickly caught himself and redirected his heart away from self-sufficiency
He remembered that he had known adversity in the past and God had delivered him: 'You have turned for me my mourning into dancing'
Whether He has brought us blessing or trial, God still deserves our gratitude and trust.
One of the major obstacles to show- ing compassion is making prejudgments about who we think is worthy of our compassion
Jesus told a parable to answer the question: 'Who is my neighbor?'
Or, who qualifies as worthy of our neighborly acts
Jesus told of a man who traveled on the notoriously dangerous road from Jerusalem to Jericho
As he traveled, he fell among thieves and was robbed, beaten, and left for dead
Religious Jews passed him, but they walked by on the other side, probably for fear of being religiously defiled
But a Samaritan came along and had unconditional compassion on the wounded stranger
Jesus' audience would have gasped at this because Jews despised Samaritans
The Samaritan could have limited or qualified his compassion because the man was a Jew
But he did not limit his neighborly kindness to those he thought were worthy
Instead, he saw a human being in need and resolved to help him
Are you limiting your kindness to the ones you deem worthy
As followers of Jesus, let us find ways to show neighborly kindness to all people, especially to those we have judged as unworthy.
Rugs, lamps, a washer and dryer, even the food in the cupboards everything was for sale
My husband and I stopped at an estate sale one day and wandered through the house
We overwhelmed by the volume of belongings
Dish sets littered the dining room table
Christmas decorations filled the front hallway
Tools, toy cars, board games, and vintage dolls crowded the garage
When we left, I wondered if the homeowners were moving, if they desperately needed money, or if they had passed away
This reminded me of these words from Ecclesiastes: 'Just exactly as he came, so shall he go'
We're born empty-handed and we leave the world the same way
The stuff we buy, organize, and store is ours only for a while, and it's all in a state of decay
Moths munch through our clothes; even gold and silver may not hold their value
Sometimes 'riches perish through misfortune'
, and our kids don't get to enjoy our possessions after we're gone
Stockpiling possessions in the here-and-now is foolish, because we can't take anything with us when we die
What's important is a proper attitude toward what we have and how we use what God has given
That way we'll be storing up our treasure where it belongs, in heaven.
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me-ee
Happy bir
After humming the 'birthday song' a second time, I turned off the faucet's running water
It is said that singing the song through twice while washing your hands is a good way to remove most bacteria
But it doesn't last
I need to repeat this process each time they are contaminated
In the Old Testament, the people of God offered sacrifices over and over to cover their sins
But the blood of the animals didn't actually 'take away sins'
Only the precious sacrifice of Jesus could do that
Animal sacrifices are no longer needed because Christ's sacrifice
'was once for all, unlike animal sacrifices, which had to be offered 'continually year by year'
'cleanses us completely from all guilt and sin, unlike the blood of animals that was a reminder of sin's penalty and could never take away our sins
'By one offering [Christ] has perfected forever those who are being sanctified'
Only through Jesus can we be declared completely clean.
A young teen who was constantly getting into trouble always apologized when his parents confronted him
No matter how much he hurt his parents with his previous wrong-doing, he would soon turn around and do something else wrong knowing he would be forgiven
Finally, his dad took him out to the garage for a talk
Dad picked up a hammer and pounded a nail into the garage wall
Then he gave his son the hammer and told him to pull out the nail
The boy shrugged, grabbed the hammer, and yanked out the nail
'That's like forgiveness, Son
When you do something wrong, it's like pounding in a nail
Forgiveness is when you pull the nail out.'
'Okay, I get it,' said the boy
'Now take the hammer and pull out the nail hole,' his dad replied
'That's impossible!' the boy said
'I can't pull it out.'
As this story illustrates and King David's life proves, sin carries consequences
Even though David was forgiven, his adultery and murder left scars and led to family problems
This sobering truth can serve as a warning for our lives
The best way to avoid the lingering damage of sin is to live a life of obedience to God.
Steve often witnesses to his co- workers
But when he mentions something directly from the Bible, someone frequently responds: 'Wait
That was written by men, and it's full of errors just like any other book.'
The following letter to the editor in our local newspaper expresses a similar thought: 'Believers cite that the Word of God is infallible, but I see no apparent reason to believe that the words written in the Bible by man are any more infallible than the words written in a science journal by man.'
How do we respond when the Scriptures are so readily dismissed as being just man's words with errors
Most of us aren't biblical scholars and may not have an answer
But if we do some reading , we'll find the evidence that it's God-inspired and therefore trustworthy
For example, consider this: Over a period of 1,600 years, 40 different authors wrote the 66 books of the Bible
There were 400 silent years between the 39 books of the Old Testament and the 27 of the New Testament
Yet, Genesis to Revelation tell one unified story
While we accept the Bible by faith, there's plenty of evidence that it's true
Let's be diligent to study and share what we learn with others.
For a dozen years, I took an auto emergency kit on every long driving trip but never had to use it
It became such a familiar item that on the night we really needed it, I forgot it was there
But fortunately my wife remembered
After hitting a deer on a dark rural highway, our van was completely disabled
While I fumbled with a small flashlight to assess the damage and call a tow truck, my wife opened the emergency kit
She set out a reflective warning marker, then turned on the bright flashlight
It is much to my surprise
Later we talked about how a crisis can cause us to forget the resources we have, just when we need them most
Paul urged the Ephesians to 'put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil'
This protective covering includes truth, righteousness, readiness, faith, salvation, and prayer
Although these spiritual resources guard us each day, we need to remember them when disaster strikes and the enemy tries to undermine our confidence in God's love and care
Use the kit
'Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand'
After his return from the moon, Neil Armstrong was often plagued by the media
Seeking greater privacy, he moved his family into a small town
But notoriety was a nuisance even there
Armstrong's barber found out that people would pay good money to get a lock of his hair
So after giving the space hero several haircuts, he sold the clippings to a buyer for $3,000
Armstrong was shocked at the barber's opportunism
The Scriptures tell of another story of disloyalty and a haircut
As a symbol of God's calling of Samson as a Nazirite, he was never to cut his hair
When the Spirit of God came upon him, he was given super-human strength over his enemies
Wanting to overpower him, the Philistines hired Delilah, a woman who had a relationship with him, to find out the secret of that strength
He foolishly told her that his power would be gone if his hair were cut
She lulled him to sleep and had him shorn
Greed can drive us to be disloyal to others and to God, causing us to make sinful choices
Our desire should be to exhibit a heart that is fully committed to love the Lord and others
He shows 'Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him'
Adults celebrate when children learn to do something on their own: get dressed, brush their teeth, tie shoelaces, ride a bike, walk to school
As adults, we like to pay our own way, live in our own houses, make our own decisions, rely on no outside help
Faced with an unexpected challenge, we seek out 'self-help' books
All the while we are systematically sealing off the heart attitude most desirable to God and most descriptive of our true state in the universe
It's what Jesus told His disciples: 'Without Me you can do nothing'
The truth is that we live in a web of dependence, at the center of which is God, in whom all things hold together
Norwegian theologian Ole Hallesby settled on the single word helplessness as the best summary of the heart attitude that God accepts as prayer
He said, 'Only he who is helpless can truly pray.'
Most parents feel a pang when the child outgrows dependence, even while knowing the growth to be healthy and normal
With God, the rules change
We never outgrow dependence, and to the extent we think we do, we delude ourselves
Prayer is our declaration of dependence upon the Lord.
Our yard makes poison ivy happy
I learned this the hard way
Even though I was being careful, I came in contact with the plant and ended up with a nasty, itchy rash
Poison ivy looks like many harmless plants, and it keeps company with some beautiful ones
One gardener couldn't figure out why she got poison ivy whenever she pruned her roses
She later discovered that a poison ivy vine was taking advantage of the tender loving care she gave to her rosebush
Some people are like toxic plants
They look harmless, and they blend in with people who, like roses, are fragrant and beautiful
Simon the sorcerer fit this description
He followed Philip and was baptized, but then he asked to buy the ability to lay hands on people so they could receive the Holy Spirit
Peter was appalled at his request and urged him to repent
Sometimes people use the favorable environment of a healthy church as a network for selfish purposes
Like poison ivy among roses, they cause much misery
Like Simon, anyone who does this needs to repent, and everyone else needs to avoid contact with such a person
Spiritual look-alikes appear good but their 'fruit' is toxic.
I can still remember what it was like to take our family on vacation, only to have the kids in the backseat mar the joy of it all by their bickering and complaining
Who doesn't remember the disruptive effects of 'Dad, she touched me!'
or 'Mom, he won't give me a turn!'
If you've had that kind of experience, you can imagine how God feels when His children quarrel and complain
Getting along is important to God
Jesus prayed that we would 'be one'
so that the world would believe He came from the Father
And to disciples who were prone to quarreling, He commanded that they love and serve one another
It should also be noted that among the seven things God hates, He includes 'one who sows discord among brethren'
So I'm not surprised that the psalmist tells us that when brothers dwell in unity, it's like 'the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard of Aaron, running down on the edge of his garments'
In ancient times, the oil of anointing was full of fragrant spices that graced the environment wherever the anointed one went
May the unity that comes from our love and service to one another fragrantly grace our families, churches, and friendships!
A while back, Our Daily Bread  published an article I wrote about a young woman who wore a T-shirt that said, 'Love Is for Losers.'
In it, I commented on what a sad message that was, and I wrote about the hurt this motto represented
To my surprise, one of our readers gave that message a completely different slant
She sent a note informing me that her daughter and her daughter's friends all tennis players wear shirts with that slogan
In tennis, a 'love' score is zero
If your score in a game is 'love' you lose so in tennis, love really is for losers
That mom's note gave me a new perspective on that saying
This incident reminded me how easy it is to make wrong first judgments
Based on incomplete or inaccurate information, we can jump to wrong conclusions and make poor value judgments about people and situations
And that can cause great hurt to others
Speaking to people who had misjudged Him, Jesus warned, 'Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment'
We need to be careful that our judgments are backed up by the right information and the right attitude
Try this motto: 'Righteous judgment is for winners.'
North America's Pacific Coast Redwoods are some of the biggest trees in the world
The tallest on record, Hyperion, soars 379 feet into the air
During a visit to California's Muir Woods National Park, I was surprised and overwhelmed by the enormity of those redwoods
Trees as tall as a 30- story building seemed to press me into the forest floor while drawing my thoughts upward
The memory of what I felt at the base of some of the tallest and oldest trees in the world has left me with lingering thoughts about their origin
Those redwoods, like the family tree of our own humanity, are rooted in a Creator who is infinitely and eternally greater than His creation
The prophet Isaiah caught a glimpse of this God
In a vision that mingled the wonders of a Messianic kingdom with the promise of a new heaven and earth, he describes One who makes the skies His throne and the earth His footstool
Yet Isaiah saw something even more overwhelming
He saw a great God who wants His people to 'be glad and rejoice forever in what I create'
In response, let's bow before Him in humble adoration .
In some homes, owners have built safe rooms, special places where they can go for protection should someone break into the house
In Proverbs 18:10, Solomon reminded God's people that God is their 'safe room' and that they could find total security in Him
In verses 10 and 11, he described two types of security to which some people run: the name of the Lord and wealth
The name or character of God is described as a 'strong tower.'
As a captured city might take refuge in a fortified tower, so the righteous could run to the Lord and find complete safety
On the other hand, the wealthy imagined their riches as a high point of safety
Solomon sought to tell his readers that money might give a sense of security but it would be a false security that could lead to laziness, pride, and destruction
Yet people who are humble and find their complete security in the unchanging and holy character of God will find true safety
Wealth may not be your particular 'safe room.'
You might tend to run instead to something or someone else when adversity comes
But we all need to learn to depend daily on the Lord and find a high point of safety in the safe room of His name.
When I was a kid, I learned a big word that was fun to pronounce: 'antidisestablishmentarianism.'
What a mouthful
I recently took the time to look it up
The dictionary defines it as 'the doctrine or political position that opposes the withdrawal of state recognition of an established church.'
The definition is almost as difficult as the term itself
Neither I nor my school friends knew what it meant
But using the big word made me look knowledgeable
When the apostle Paul ministered to people, he didn't try to impress others
In his letter to the Corinthians, he wrote: 'When I came to you, [I] did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God'
'Excellence of speech' is the translation of Greek words meaning 'high-sounding words' or 'pompous speech.'
This implies using words to exalt self instead of to instruct others
Paul was a brilliant scholar who expressed the deep things of God in Scripture
Yet he did not use lofty language to elevate his self-importance
As we grow in our understanding of God's Word, let's follow Paul's example and guard against parading knowledge for knowledge's sake
Instead, let's use well-chosen words that build up and encourage others.
In August 1914, when Britain entered World War I, Oswald Chambers was 40 years old with a wife and a 1-year-old daughter
It wasn't long before men were joining the army at the rate of 30,000 a day, people were asked to sell their automobiles and farm horses to the government, and lists of the dead and wounded began appearing in daily newspapers
The nation faced economic uncertainty and peril
A month into the war, Chambers spoke of the spiritual challenge facing followers of Christ: 'We must take heed that in the present calamities, when war and devastation and heart-break are abroad in the world, we do not shut ourselves up in a world of our own and ignore the demand made on us by our Lord and our fellowmen for the service of intercessory prayer and hospitality and care.'
God's call to His people rings true in every age: 'If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday'
Fear causes us to grasp what we have; faith in God opens our hands and hearts to others
We walk in His light when we help others, not hoard for ourselves.
The Energizer Bunny can't top the Service Partners of RBC Ministries
RBC, the publishers of Our Daily Bread, has a volunteer program called Service Partners 
This program gives people the opportunity to donate their skills and time helping us accomplish our mission 'to make the life-changing wisdom of the Bible understandable and accessible to all.'
Some of the Service Partners are well past retirement age
Despite the aches, pains, and limitations of advancing age, they show up regularly and serve cheerfully at a variety of tasks
In 2009, they completed 100,000 hours in service since the program's inception
They just keep going and going  not unlike the famous pink bunny
Their example is a reminder that there is no 'use by' date on our earthly lives
Scripture doesn't designate a retirement age for believers
But there is an end product for our service one unrelated to age
In describing the results of the efforts of 'pastors and teachers,'
Paul says their purpose is to equip 'the saints for the work of ministry'
And that 'work of ministry,' which is the job of all believers, can lead to 'the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God'
This task should 'keep us going' for the rest of our lives.
On a whim, I bought a red foil balloon at the grocery store
The message 'I Love You' streamed across the front in billowy script
As I was loading bags into my car, the balloon's string slid through my fingers
I stood there watching it float away, and soon it was nothing more than a tiny red dot finally, just a memory
Losing that balloon reminded me of the way love sometimes vanishes from lives
Children rebel and distance themselves; spouses or loved ones desert; close friends stop calling
I'm so thankful that God's love is steady; it can sustain us when love here on earth drifts away
In fact, it's so reliable that Jesus invites us to abide in His love
He wants us to know it's okay to settle in and get comfortable
We can always remain in God's tender embrace because 'neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come' , or anything else, can ever separate us from His love through Christ
Once we trust Christ as Savior, the guarantee of God's love is ours forever
Have you watched love disappear from your life
Rest in God's affection His constant care will keep your heart safely secured.
Despite my best efforts to write clearly, sometimes I'm misunderstood
I feel bad about my failure and try to improve my skills
Occasionally, however, readers take words out of context or read into them something that bears no resemblance to the intended meaning
This is frustrating because there's no way to control how people use words once they are published
This brings to mind a much more serious offense, that of misusing the words of the Lord
The prophets in Jeremiah's day did this
They put their own words into God's mouth by claiming He said things they wanted to be true but that God had never said
So the Lord told His people, 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you
They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord'
Then the Lord warned the people that He would forsake those who pervert His words and cast them from His presence
In contrast, the apostle Paul made a point of saying that he did not handle the Word of God deceitfully
He knew the danger of preaching his own ideas rather than God's
All of us need to be careful to use God's Word for His purpose, rather than for our own agenda.
I told my doctor who is an agnostic that he should be glad God created us
Seeing a needle in his hands, I wondered, Perhaps I should keep quiet
But I added, 'If we are still evolving, then you wouldn't know the exact spots to place those needles.'
He asked, 'Do you really believe in God?'
I replied, 'Of course
Aren't we intricately made?'
I was thankful for this opportunity to begin to witness to my doctor
In today's Bible reading, Paul charged Timothy to point people to the Savior
'Preach the Word' is not addressed only to preachers, however
The word preach means 'to make it known.'
God's people can do this over a cup of coffee or in school with friends
We can make known the good news of what God has done for us wherever, whenever, and to anyone who is open and seeking
We can let them know that God loves us and sees our hurts, failures, and weaknesses
Through the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus, God broke the stranglehold of sin over us
And to all those who will open their heart to the Savior, He will come to live in them
Let's not be afraid to make known what God has done for us.
In the 1930s, jockey Johnny Longden was rammed in mid-race
While thundering steeds came up from behind, Johnny was thrown sideways off his horse
Seeing his predicament, another jockey reached out and attempted to push Longden back up on his mount
Unfortunately, he pushed too hard and Longden flew over the horse onto the other side
Still another jockey nearby grabbed him and was able to help him safely back on his horse
Amazingly, Johnny Longden won the race
A newspaper dubbed it 'the ultimate impossibility.'
Helping hands had not only saved him from severe injury and possible death, but allowed him to win the race
As believers, we are to offer a helping hand to others as well
In Proverbs 31, we read of the virtuous woman who 'extends her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy'
For centuries, the compassion of this woman of faith has been an inspiration to both men and women
She helps to remind us that extending ourselves to others is a biblical virtue to be exhibited by all believers
There are many who are struggling or have fallen on hard times and need our assistance
Who in your life needs a helping hand?
When people ask Michael St Jacques, a Franciscan brother, what he's wearing, he says, 'It's called a habit.'
He wears the distinctive brown robe for a definite reason
St Jacques told Hemispheres magazine, 'We have the choice to wear it, and a lot of us make a real effort to because it acts as a magnet
People tell me things they've never told anyone
Complete strangers will confess something they did 30 years ago and ask if God can forgive them.'
You might say that Michael is clothed in 'approachability.'
Throughout the Gospels, we find that all types of people approached Jesus wherever He went
They came to be taught, helped, healed, accepted, and forgiven
When some criticized Jesus for associating with tax collectors and sinners, people they considered undesirable, Jesus said, 'Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick
I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance'
Do people see us as aloof or accessible
When we become so focused on our own plans that we have no time for others, we are not clothed with the spirit of Christ
When the Savior lives through us, His open arms invite people to open their hearts and unburden their souls.
Why do some trees turn into a collage of radiant maroon, red, orange, and yellow colors in the fall
Trees are green in the summer because chlorophyll, a green pigment in the leaves, absorbs red and blue light from the sun
The light reflected from the leaves appears green to our eyes
Chlorophyll is an unstable substance, and bright sunlight causes it to decompose rapidly
Therefore, plants must continuously synthesize and regenerate it
The shortening days and cool nights of autumn, however, interfere with this process
As chlorophyll breaks down, the green colors of the leaves begin to fade
Some trees change from green to bright yellow as the chlorophyll degrades
In others, the action of sugar in the leaves creates a red pigment, causing the leaves to turn maroon, purple, and bright red as the chlorophyll fades
But why do we have color
It seems to serve no practical purpose at least none that scientists can discern
And why are there photoreceptors in our eyes that enable us to see it
I believe that God's goodness is the point of His creation
He is 'good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works'
He colored the world for our childlike delight
He's like that, you know.
What's the first image you see when you turn on your computer
Maybe it's a family portrait or a special vacation picture
Or perhaps your favorite pro athlete
How about an artist's rendition of Jesus
A man once wrote to me about his lengthy battle with pornography a disheartening cycle that punctuated seasons of victory with crushing forays back into an online world of empty lust
Finally, he found that putting a visible reminder of Jesus in the corner of his computer screen helped him achieve lasting victory
That constant reminder of the One who set him free caused the offensive Web sites to lose their appeal
The man wasn't tapping into some gigabyte good-luck charm
He was giving himself a simple reminder of the teaching of Colossians 3 where Paul says, 'put to death fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness'
When we turn our eyes toward Jesus, He becomes a powerful reminder that our old life 'died, and [our] life is hidden with Christ in God'
Whether it's a verse taped to the dashboard of your car or a picture on your computer, choose a tangible way to lift your thoughts into the presence of Jesus.
Popularity is fickle
Just ask a politician
Many of them watch their ratings to see how their constituents view their policies
They may start with a high rating, but then it steadily declines during their term
Jesus also experienced a sharp decline in popularity
His popularity reached its peak after He fed the 5,000
It plummeted when He told His listeners that He had 'come down from heaven'
Their response to His stupendous claim was, essentially, Who does this guy think He is?
Jesus' popularity continued to dip when He explained how they could have Him as spiritual bread
Perplexed by what they heard, they said, 'This is a hard saying; who can understand it?'
As a result, many left Him
The crowds followed Jesus conditionally
They were happy only as long as Jesus supplied their needs and met their wants
They balked when He asked for commitment
Jesus' question to His disciples was 'Do you also want to go away?'
Peter answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go
You have the words of eternal life'
Will you, like Peter, choose to ignore the world's rating of Jesus and follow Him daily?
If we're not careful, we may become like the man who prided himself on being an expert archer
The secret to his success was that after he shot his arrow at the side of a barn, he painted a bull's-eye around the arrow
It's easy to live our lives doing what we want and thinking that our ways and instincts are right on target
when in reality our 'bull's-eye' shots at life are not on target at all
Proverbs 14:12 says, 'There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.'
Sometimes it may feel right to seek revenge, hoard money, chase pleasure, or yell at people who yell at us
But God's ways are different from ours
He has painted a bull's-eye on forgiving those who have hurt us, on giving generously to those in need, on living to please Him rather than ourselves, and on turning the other cheek
We need to pray, 'Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth'
And then we need to aim to follow His ways in all that we do and say
But we all need help to aim at the right target
Thankfully, the bull's-eye is already painted in the brushstrokes of God's truth as revealed in His Word
When we aim our lives at God's Word, we'll discover that His ways are right on target, every time!
Our church's young people did what they could to 'construct heaven.'
It was time for the spring banquet, and the creative teens used lights, Styrofoam, and other materials to turn the auditorium into their best idea of heaven
The theme of the banquet was 'I Can Only Imagine,' from the song by MercyMe
Our daughter Melissa helped transform the church
When I visited to see how the kids were doing, she was in the rafters hanging stars
The night of the banquet, my wife and I were able to hear one of Melissa's friends sing the theme song as we all thought about this faraway place called heaven
Of course, we never could have imagined that Melissa would be entering the real heaven just 6 weeks later
The imaginary would become reality
Jesus told us about heaven as a way of untroubling our hearts
He said, 'Let not your heart be troubled;
in My Father's house are many mansions
I go to prepare a place for you'
Heaven is a prepared place for prepared hearts, a place of unimaginable beauty, splendor, and majesty
It's where God is caring for our believing loved ones, and someday for us
Imagine heaven, and rejoice!
The waves of Lake Michigan were high and splashing onto the pier one day as I followed a young family out to a lighthouse
I overheard the young girl say to her father: 'Daddy, please walk alongside me and hold my hand at this scary part.'
Sometimes life can be scary for us too: Loss of loved ones, Financial woes, Health problems
As we carry these heavy burdens and cares, we long for a strong hand to hold ours to keep us steady and secure
When Joshua took over the leadership of Israel, Moses reminded him of God's help in tough times
In the difficult days to come, Joshua would need to remember to trust God and His promises
Moses said, 'The Lord, He is the One who goes before you
He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed'
Isaiah 41:13 encourages us with these words from God: 'I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, '\sFear not, I will help you.'
This song by Lowell Alexander reminds us of God's presence: 'You will face mountains so steep, deserts so long, and valleys so deep
Sometimes the journey's gentle, sometimes the cold winds blow
But I want you to remember, I want you to know you will never walk alone
Jesus will be right beside you all the way.'
He'll walk alongside us and hold our hand at the 'scary' parts.
In his book The First Man, James Hansen chronicles Neil Armstrong's flight to the moon
The author explains how each astronaut was asked to fill out a report upon completion of the flight
The report listed how they traveled from Houston, Texas, to Cape Kennedy, Florida, to the Moon, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hawaii, and returned to Houston, Texas
What a list of destinations
There is another itinerary that outshines any trip ever taken
Imagine this itinerary of our Savior, Jesus Christ: Place of origin the heavenly places; Initial destination Bethlehem; Mode of travel the virgin birth; Reason for travel the redemption of sinners; Return destination, the right hand of the Father
Philippians 2:5-11 eloquently describes Christ's coming to earth to provide our redemption
One Bible commentator considers this passage a hymn of praise to the glory of the Suffering Servant who became exalted for His obedience: 'Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death
Therefore God also has highly exalted Him'
Our Lord's extraordinary itinerary of redemption should fill our hearts with gratitude and praise!
On a recent radio program, the hosts spoke with a 'crisis management' expert about how a celebrity can recover from a public relations disaster
This specialist said one of the keys was to build strong allies who can help the star rehabilitate his or her image
In other words, it is vital when in trouble to get the right help
That is wise counsel, for at the heart of all crisis management is recognizing that we can't accomplish everything on our own
Some challenges are too big
Some mountains are too high
In our own seasons of crisis, it is critical that we have help
That's why it's comforting to know that we have the strongest ally possible
King David knew about that ally
In Psalm 18:6, he affirmed, 'In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God; 
He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, even to His ears.'
There is no greater help in our time of need than God
He alone can carry us through the trials and crises of life, and we have His word that He will never leave us nor forsake us
When crisis hits, we don't have to stand alone
We have the right help
We can depend on God to be the greatest ally we could ever know
Lean on Him.
People who are trying to be friendly sometimes ask, 'Are you keeping busy?'
The question seems harmless, but in my mind it carries a subtle message
Beneath the surface is a test of personal value
If I can't rattle off a list of things I have to do, I feel as if I'm admitting that I'm not worth much
But does God determine our value by how busy we are
Does He calculate our worth by how much we accomplish
Does He reward us for living on the edge of exhaustion and not taking care of ourselves
One of the first verses I learned as a child was Matthew 11:28, 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'
It didn't mean much to me at the time because I didn't understand weariness
But now that I'm older, I feel the temptation to keep pace with the world so I won't be left behind
But followers of Jesus don't have to live like that
Not only has He released us from slavery to sin but also from the bondage of having to prove our worth
Accomplishing a lot for God may make us feel important, but what makes us important to God is what we allow Him to accomplish in us conforming us into the image of His Son .
Many churches celebrate the first Sunday in October as World Communion Sunday
It is a time to observe the Lord's Supper with a special awareness of celebrating together with our brothers and sisters in Christ around the globe
On this day, being with a community of believers has become very meaningful to me
One year, however, I found myself in an airport with a long flight ahead and no opportunity to attend church on that day
Sitting alone, I read the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper, along with the passages describing Jesus' arrest and crucifixion
Then from 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, I pondered the words so often read at communion services: 'The Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread
With some common elements to represent the bread and the cup, I observed the Lord's death for us, feeling a deep kinship with those followers of Christ in many places who are unable or forbidden to gather with others in worship
Whatever your location and circumstances today, may you find joy and strength in remembering the Lord's sacrifice on the cross
'For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He comes'
Remember when phones were for making phone calls
With the advent of the smart phone, what was once a way to talk to someone has become a storehouse of data
Add cell-phone applications to that, and you can read sports reports, play games, plan trips, find an apartment, or any of well over 100,000 other tasks available with an 'app.'
That's pretty amazing, but the 'apps' for phones are nothing compared with the kind of 'apps' Scripture gives us
The 'applications' of the Bible are direct notes from God telling us how to apply the truth of His Word to all of life
Take Philippians 2, for instance: The unity app , the humility app , the no-grumbling app , the shine-as-lights app
Or look at the apps of Ephesians 5: The imitate-God app , the walk-in-love app , the purity app , the tongue app
And the book of Proverbs
It's teeming with applications
You don't have to wait for someone to offer these on the Internet
Just open the Bible and see the hundreds of ways to apply Scripture in your life
Got a question about the Christian life
Search the Bible
The answers are there, waiting to be discovered.
Because I am not a 'fix it' kind of guy, I had to call a friend who is a great handyman to make some repairs in my home recently
He came over, and I gave him my list
But to my surprise, he told me I would be doing the repairs myself
He modeled for me how to do it, instructed me along the way, and stayed with me
I followed his example and successfully made the repairs
This modeling seems close to what Jesus did when He called His first disciples
When Jesus called those men to follow Him, He wanted them to be with Him and to teach the good news of the kingdom of God
The first job would require being under the immediate super-vision of Jesus learning His words and interpretation of the Scriptures and watching His behavior
For the second task, Jesus sent them out to preach , saying what He said and doing what He did
As they carried out these tasks, they were to be dependent on Jesus
Today, Jesus is still calling His followers to this simple, yet powerful process of discipleship being with Him
Are you one who is dependent on Him as you're following Him today?
Several years ago, my husband helped to lead a work crew of high school students on a short-term missions trip to a Christian school in an urban community
Unfortunately, Tom had broken his foot shortly before the trip and was supervising the work from a wheelchair
He was discouraged because he wasn't able to get around as he had hoped
While he was working on the ground floor, a few of the girls were painting on the third floor
He could hear them singing praise choruses in harmony as their voices echoed down the wide-open staircases
Song after song ministered to him
'It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard,' he told me later
'And it lifted my spirits.'
Colossians 3 reminds us, 'Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord'
Not only were those teenage girls giving sweet praise to God, they were ministering to a co-worker
Whatever you're doing today, cultivate an attitude of praise
Whether it is through song or conversation, let your joy in the Lord reverberate to others
You never know who you might encourage.
The people of Israel had backslidden, and God wanted Hosea to show them how much that hurt Him
So, in the first few chapters of Hosea, we read a bizarre story: God commanded the prophet to marry a prostitute named Gomer
Put on display as the faithful husband of an unfaithful spouse, Hosea experienced a pain similar to what God felt when Israel was spiritually unfaithful
As Hosea wrote the ending of his book, he made it clear that despite the pain the people of Israel caused the living God, He still promised healing, forgiveness, and fruitfulness if they would return to Him: 'I will heal their backsliding,'
He said 'I will love them freely
Those who dwell under his shadow shall return'
Life for the person who turns his back on God is often characterized by guilt and dissatisfaction
The truly born-again believer who has fallen into a lifestyle of sin knows deep down that spiritual unfaithfulness to God takes a toll
But just as the God of grace offered Israel forgiveness and fruitfulness, even so today He offers restoration to the truly repentant
Have you made poor choices that have caused you to slip away
Come back
Repent and seek restored fellowship with the Lord today.
When we think about the marvel of creation, how God spoke the universe into existence and formed the earth and everything in it we think most often of Old Testament accounts
But it is encouraging to examine the New Testament to see how that part of the Bible refers to creation
Here is a look at some key passages: 'I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world'
God reveals things to us that He had kept secret since before creation
'Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world'
Before the earth was created, God knew each of us, and He knew our future
'He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world'
Before the work of creation even began, God was aware of each of His eventual children
These New Testament verses comfort us with the truth that God's knowledge of us and His eternal mysteries about us point toward His special creation of mankind as described in Genesis
We can do nothing but bow in awe before One whose knowledge and creative ability are eternal in nature and boundless in power
Creation: New Testament style still another reason to give God praise!
In the New Testament, hospitality is a hallmark of Christian living
It is listed as a characteristic of church leaders and is commanded for every follower of Jesus as an expression of love
But its meaning goes deeper than being a gracious host or opening our homes to guests
The Greek word translated 'hospitality'
means 'love of strangers.'
When Paul speaks of being 'given to hospitality'
, he is calling us to pursue relationships with people who are in need
It is not an easy task
Writer Henri Nouwen likens it to reaching out to those we meet on our way through life people who may be estranged from their culture, country, friends, family, or even from God
Nouwen writes: 'Hospitality, therefore, means primarily the creation of a free space where the stranger can enter and become a friend instead of an enemy
Hospitality is not to change people, but to offer them space where change can take place.'
Whether we inhabit a home, a college dorm, a prison cell, or a military barracks, we can welcome others as a way of showing our love for them and for Christ
Hospitality is making room for people in need.
People around the world are familiar with Mount Rushmore
The South Dakota site where the heads of former American presidents are carved in gigantic scale on a cliff wall
Yet, while millions know of Mount Rushmore, relatively few know the name Doane Robinson the South Dakota state historian who conceived the idea of the magnificent sculpture and managed the project
The monument is admired and appreciated, but he is the forgotten man behind the masterpiece
His name is largely unrecognized or was never even known by some
Sometimes, in the service of the Master, we may feel that we have been forgotten or are behind the scenes and not recognized
Ministry can be a life of effort that often goes unappreciated by the very people we are seeking to serve in Jesus' name
The good news, however, is that, while people may not know, God does
Hebrews 6:10 says, 'For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.'
What a promise
Our heavenly Father will never forget our service to Him
That is infinitely more important than being applauded by the crowds.
My husband and I rode the train backward from Grand Rapids to Chicago last summer
Sitting in seats that faced the rear of the train
all we could see was where we had been, not where we were going
Buildings, lakes, and trees flew by the window after we had passed them
I didn't like it
I'd rather see where I'm going
Sometimes we may feel that way about life too wishing we could see ahead
We'd like to know how certain situations are going to turn out, how God is going to answer our prayers
But all we can know is where we've been
That is, if it were not for faith
The 'faith chapter'
of the Bible, Hebrews 11, tells us about two realities that some people in Old Testament times could see by faith
It speaks of Noah, Abraham, and Sarah, who all died in faith, 'having seen [the promises] afar off.'
They 'embraced them'
and looked forward to 'a better heavenly country'
Besides the promise of heaven, verse 27 tells us that by faith Moses could also see 'Him who is invisible,' meaning Christ
While we don't know the outcome of today's struggles, believers in Jesus can by faith see forward to where we're going: We will have a heavenly home where we will live with Jesus forever.
I read about Captain Ray Baker who flew for the Strategic Air Command during the Vietnam War
The Air Force trained him, along with the other pilots, to run out of their barracks to their planes at the sound of a buzzer
Many times during dinner he had to drop his utensils and bolt to his bomber
He had been trained to respond to the call with immediate obedience
He was so well-trained that one day while on furlough, he ran out of a restaurant when he heard a buzzer
When Jesus called His first followers, they had an immediacy in their response to His call
The call of these fishermen was abrupt
Yet 'they immediately left their nets and followed Him'
The author of this account, Mark, may have wanted to impress upon his readers the authority of Jesus
When He extended the call, these men jumped to obey because helping people enter the kingdom of God was a more compelling adventure and a grander vision than catching fish
When Jesus issues a call to follow Him, He doesn't want us to delay
He expects immediate obedience when it comes to telling others the good news
Bring someone the story of salvation today!
The writer of Proverbs describes an unwise person as 'one who speaks like the piercings of a sword'
Our tongues can be like a multi-bladed Swiss Army knife when it comes to the variety of ways that we cut and destroy each other
Unhealthy attitudes of anger, irritation, frustration, and impatience even disappointment, stress, guilt, and insecurity all contribute to our damaging speech
And as we cut with our words, we wound and divide friendships and relationships
It's no wonder that the infamous list of seven things that are an abomination to the Lord includes anyone who 'sows discord among brethren'
How do we stay off that list
For starters, we need to watch what we say
Gossip and slander are out, and words that hurt instead of heal are not welcome
Boasting, lying, and all the rest of the ways we use words to hurt and divide need to be gone as well
In their place, words that extend love and the healing power of forgiveness, mercy, and truth should rule our words and relationships
After all, where would we be if Jesus hadn't spoken words of forgiving love and grace to us
So, put the 'knife'
away and use your words to help and heal.
Trust, but verify.'
My husband loves that quote from Ronald Reagan
During his time in office, the former US President wanted to believe everything he was told in his political dealings with others
But since the security of his country depended on the truth being told he strived to verify everything
Acts 17:11 tells us that the Bereans had a similar attitude about knowing the truth
'They received the Word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.'
In other words, the Bereans didn't simply believe what someone else was telling them
They also verified it on their own, on a daily basis
That's important for us to consider as well
Whether we receive our Bible teaching through church, Sunday school, radio, or TV we need to test what we hear against God's inspired Word
We are to 'be diligent to present [ourselves] approved to God, 
rightly dividing the Word of truth'
If we do this, we won't become prey to those who teach 'a different gospel,' and those who 'want to pervert the gospel of Christ' false teachers who come as wolves in sheep's clothing
Remember, trust but verify!
Have you ever wondered how an airplane pilot knows how to get from point A to point B
Most likely, he uses VOR, short for VHF Omni-directional Radio Range, a navigational system invented in the early 1950s
It still guides many aircraft to their destination today
The pilot sets the course of the aircraft on his dial
If the aircraft drifts from that set course, the instrument shows the pilot that the plane is deviating
so he can correct it to align the aircraft to the set course again
The nation of Israel in Isaiah's day badly needed a reliable VOR system
And God wanted to be that for them
But despite God's warning, they decided to align with Egypt
God graciously promised that one day, however, He would be their navigator: 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, '\sThis is the way, walk in it.' Whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left'
Today, Christians have an internal navigational system
Jesus sent the Holy Spirit, who lives in us to 'guide [us] into all truth'
If you need direction as to where to set the course of your life, don't rely on your own way
Use God's VOR system
He will surely lead you in the right direction.
Maggie doesn't care much for television
She would rather look out a window than stare at a small screen
Reading doesn't thrill her either
She has been known to 'chew' on books, but only in the strictly literal sense
Nevertheless, when Jay and I read or watch TV, Maggie participates
Even though she doesn't enjoy what we're doing, she enjoys being with us
Maggie is our very devoted dog
More than anything Maggie wants to be with us
The word dogged means 'determined and persistent.'
These words describe Maggie
They should also describe us
When we are devoted to God, we want to be with Him even when He's doing something that makes no sense to us
We may ask, 'Why, Lord?'
when He seems angry or when He seems to be napping , or when the wicked prosper
But when we remain devoted to God despite our questions, we find fullness of joy in His presence
Jesus knew that we would have questions
To prepare us for them, He urged us to abide in His love
Even when God's ways are inexplicable, His love is reliable
So we remain doggedly devoted to Him.
The word Ebenezer in the hymn 'Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing' refers to a time when the people of Israel were trying to regain the close relationship they once had with God
Their spiritual leader, Samuel, told them that if they would abandon their foreign gods and return to the Lord wholeheartedly, He would deliver them from being oppressed by their enemy, the Philistines
When the people turned from their sin, God gave them victory
In response, 'Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, '\sThus far the Lord has helped us'
When we sing, 'Here I raise my Ebenezer; hither by Thy help I've come; and I hope, by Thy good pleasure, safely to arrive at home,'
we are reminded that in our times of need we can always turn to God to find forgiveness and help
Whatever we have done, wherever we have wandered, He will receive and restore us by His grace
A small stone on a desk or shelf can be our own Ebenezer a powerful, visible reminder that by God's help we have come this far in life, and He will see us through to the end.
I was at my grandson's eighth-grade football game when the referee indicated there was a penalty and stopped play
Apparently, after the ball was thrown, the boy who passed it was tackled, prompting a penalty flag
The announcer from the press box said: 'There is a flag on the field
The penalty is roughing the pastor, I mean, roughing the passer.'
As soon as he said it, I thought to myself, God could give that penalty to some churches today
It's not that pastors are perfect
If that is what we are looking for, then pastorless churches would be the norm
It's that God calls on us to honor those who lead us spiritually, particularly 'those who labor in preaching and teaching'
In my opinion, pastoring is one of the hardest occupations on the planet
We live in a sophisticated, fast-paced, and complex world, and our expectations for 'high-performance' pastors often set the bar at unattainable heights
So, let's switch the focus and become high-performance church members who honor our pastors with words of encouragement and prayer
A supportive note or a 'thank you' in the foyer will go a long way to stimulate pastors to serve with joy and efficiency.
In 1945, professional golfer Byron Nelson had an unimaginable season
Of the 30 tournaments he entered, he won an amazing 18 times including 11 in a row
Had he chosen to, he could have continued his career and perhaps become the greatest of all time
But that was not his goal
His goal was to earn enough money playing golf to buy a ranch and spend his life doing what he really loved
So, instead of continuing on at the peak of his career, Nelson retired at age 34 to become a rancher
He had different goals
The world may find that kind of thinking to be foolish
It doesn't really understand the heart that looks beyond trying to gain more wealth or fame to real satisfaction and contentment
This is especially true when it comes to our choice to live for Christ
But it is in the world's perception of our alleged foolishness that we might best represent the Master's different goals to this world
Paul wrote, 'But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty'
A commitment to living according to kingdom values might brand us as foolish in the eyes of the world, but it can bring honor to our God.
Growing up around the woods and waters of Midwest America, I've been fascinated with natural wildlife native to our region
But on a recent trip to the California coast, I found myself staring in breathtaking wonder at snorting elephant seals, barking sea lions, and a forest of silent redwoods
I watched pelicans soar in formation, and I saw migrating whales spouting in the distance
Together they are just a sampling of the millions of species that make up the intricate and delicate balance of nature
According to the Bible, the variety of the natural world is designed to do far more than inspire childlike wonder
The mysteries of nature can help us come to terms with a God who allows inexpressible, unexplainable pain and suffering
We see this in the epic story of Job
While he was suffering, Job didn't know that God had such a high regard for him that he allowed Satan to test his faith with a series of losses
What emerges is this eventual, unavoidable conclusion: A Creator who has the wisdom and power to design the wonders of nature is great enough to be trusted with pain and suffering that are beyond our ability to understand
In awe, Job proclaimed, 'I know that You can do everything'
We can trust that kind of God, no matter what.
One of the coolest things hanging on the wall in my home office is a Certificate of Authenticity
It has on it the logo of US Space Shuttle flight 110, which was launched in April 2002
Aboard the Atlantis on that flight was Mission Specialist Rex Walheim, who took into outer space an article from Our Daily Bread titled 'Seeing God's Glory.'
Lt Col Walheim sent me the certificate to prove that this devotional page actually left earth's atmosphere
Sometimes we need these kinds of things, documents that verify truth
If I were to show that article to someone and say, 'This flew on the Space Shuttle,'
I could be doubted because I would have no proof
But when Walheim sent me the Certificate of Authenticity, he gave me verification
In 1 Peter, Simon Peter created a Certificate of Authenticity for his message about the grace of God
In chapter 5, he wrote, 'I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this [letter] is the true grace of God'
Peter was assuring his readers that the many messages of 1 Peter themes of hope and courage and even suffering were all authentic and demonstrate the grace of God
Looking for evidence of God's grace
Read 1 Peter, and be confident that its teaching is the real deal.
After dinner one night, a tiny brown sparrow flew inside our house through the front door
A chase ensued
Each time my husband got near to it, the little intruder fluttered away in a desperate search for an exit
Before we could escort it safely outside, the bird toured the house so frantically that we could see its chest throbbing from its rapid heartbeat
Sometimes we are like that little bird anxious, frazzled, and afraid of what might happen next
It comforts me to think that 'not one [sparrow] falls to the ground' without God knowing about it
He sees and knows everything in our world
'The eyes of the Lord are in every place'
, and nothing escapes His attention, including you and me
God understands and values the finest points of our being
Jesus said, 'The very hairs of your head are all numbered'
It's amazing that God keeps a tally of our personal trivia and is even aware of a bird's misfortune
Since He knows about these small details, we can trust that He sees and cares about the big issues that ruffle our feathers
When we ask Him for help, God's response is always informed by His perfect knowledge of us and our circumstances
Let's trust Him with our anxious concerns.
On June 6, 1944, Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, was the most powerful man on earth
Under his authority, the largest amphibious army ever assembled prepared to liberate the Nazi-dominated continent of Europe
How was Eisenhower able to lead such a vast army
Part of the answer can be linked to his remarkable skill in working with different kinds of people
What many do not know, however, is that Ike hadn't always gotten along with others
As a boy, he often got into fistfights at school
But fortunately he had a caring mother who instructed him in God's Word
One time, when she was bandaging his hands after an angry outburst, she quoted Proverbs 16:32, 'He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.'
Years later, Eisenhower wrote, 'I have always looked back on that conversation as one of the most valuable moments of my life.'
Undoubtedly, by learning to control his anger, Eisenhower was able to work effectively with others
Inevitably, each of us will at times be tempted to lash out in anger
Yet through God's work in our lives we can learn to control our anger
What better way to influence people than through a gentle spirit.
Early on a sunny Sunday afternoon after church, I headed out for a walk around the neighborhood
A man was trimming his grass along the sidewalk, and we greeted each other with the usual 'Hello, how are you?'
In a negative tone, he replied, 'It's just another Sunday.'
Later, I wondered what he had meant by that
Was he saying, I'm just doing my chores going through the motions
Sometimes even church attendance can become a matter of merely going through the motions on just another Sunday
For the believers in the early church , joining with fellow believers was a source of excitement
That was when the church first started and everyone was a new believer so they were bound to be enthusiastic
But what about us
What can we do to make each Sunday special
Go with the anticipation of meeting with God
While He is with us all the time , God is with us in a unique way as we gather with others who know Him
Bring your burdens and praises to Him
Go to learn about God
We may not learn something new every week, but we can always be encouraged by the truths of God's Word
Expect to hear from Him
Go to fellowship with others
We need each other in this Christian journey
Encourage others, challenge them in their faith, and pray for them
Lord, give us a renewed enthusiasm of heart for attending church, so that it won't be just another Sunday.
Glance at any newspaper and the headlines tell you what's wrong with the world
Watch television, listen to the radio, talk to friends, and you will find no shortage of opinions as to what is wrong on planet Earth
That's because pointing out what's wrong is easy
When terrorists hijacked passenger planes and slammed them into the Pentagon, two New York skyscrapers, and a Pennsylvania field, the world quickly called it evil
The destructive power of this epic evil event made people feel paralyzed and helpless
And that's what evil does best; it makes us feel powerless
But we're not
Most of us experience evil on a smaller, more personal scale
And for us, the apostle Paul outlined the proper response
He said we are to abhor evil , not to repay it with more evil , and not to be overcome by it
The true victim of evil is goodness the goodness that God designed as part of creation for everyone to enjoy
It is surprising then when Paul concludes that the casualty of evil is also its conqueror
Evil gets all the headlines, but God's goodness is stronger, and He wants us to use it on His behalf to overcome His enemy.
In my college years I worked as a guide
I take boys on treks into Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado
On one occasion one of my hikers a small, slow chap lagged behind and took the wrong fork on a trail
When we arrived at our campsite he was nowhere to be found
I frantically went out to search for him
Just before dark, I came across him sitting by a small lake utterly lost and alone
In my joy, I gave him a bear hug, hoisted him on my shoulders, and carried him down the trail to his companions
In a story by Scottish writer George MacDonald, he describes a young woman finding a child alone and lost in the woods
She gathered him up in her arms and carried him home to her father
At which point she gained an insight that was never to leave her: 'Now she understood the heart of the Son of Man, [who came] to find and carry back the stray children to their Father and His.'
I want you too to know the heart of Jesus, the Son of Man, who came to find and carry back His straying children to their Father, 'for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost'
No matter how far you may have strayed and how lost you may be, He came to seek and to save you.
As a result of adult children neglecting their responsibilities, some elderly parents in Singapore are forced to seek financial help from charities and other state agencies
Speaking about this escalating situation, a government official said, 'We cannot legislate love.'
In the Bible, however, love is commanded
That is what Moses told the nation of Israel: 'I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways'
And Jesus said that the greatest commandment is to 'love the Lord your God'
How can God command love
His supreme display of love at Calvary gave Him that right
Jesus' beloved disciple, John, wrote: 'By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us
This is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment'
What opportunities do you have to obey God's command to love
Honoring parents by caring and providing for them
Ministering to a sick friend
Offering a gracious and kind word to someone who is difficult to love
Lord, because You laid down Your life for us, help us to show love to others.
In November 2008, the US Supreme Court debated the constitutional limits on foul language
The Federal Communications Commission cited a national broadcasting company for allowing two entertainers to use two common profanities on the air
The broadcasting company argued that 'fleeting' profanity that was not blatantly sexual should not be punished
Others countered that it is our duty to protect children from such language
The issue of inappropriate language was not up for debate in the church at Ephesus
Paul instructed believers that one of the ways they were to respond to the blessings of redemption and being made alive in Christ was by guarding their speech
Paul did not want them to be characterized by their old way of living, which included corrupt and unwholesome speech, profanity, malicious gossip, slander, or anything that injures another and sparks dissension
Instead, he wanted the Ephesians through their words to 'impart grace' and encouragement, as the need arose
As followers of Jesus Christ, we want the words that flow from our hearts and out of our mouths to be a life-giving spring
And may all who hear our words receive a blessing.
One of my boyhood hobbies was building model planes
Every time I opened a new box, the first thing I saw was the instructions, but I didn't think I needed to follow them
In my mind I knew exactly how to put the model together
Not until I had glued a few pieces together did I realize I had skipped an important step, like putting the pilot in the cockpit
It's easy to think that we have no need for instructions for our lives, only to later realize that we've messed things up
Which is exactly why Jesus advised that following His instructions is the way for wise people to build a safe, solid, and significant life
He had just told the listening crowd to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile, to forgive enemies, and to sell treasures so that they could give to the poor
But just getting the instructions isn't enough
The key is to follow them
'Whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock'
Those who don't follow the instructions are, as Jesus put it, 'foolish'
To the world, forgiving your enemies and giving to the poor may seem like a silly way to build a life, but, take it from Jesus, it's the wise way.
On Jack Borden's 101st birthday, he awoke at 5 a.m., ate a hearty breakfast, and was at his law office by 6:30 ready to begin his day
When asked the secret of his long life, the practicing attorney smiled and quipped, 'Not dying.'
But there's more to it than that
Mr Borden, who was baptized at age 11 in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, told Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter David Casstevens, 'I'm a firm believer that God has His hand in everything that happens
He is letting me live for some reason
I try to do the things that I believe He wants me to.'
Ezra the priest experienced the 'good hand of his God upon him'
when he led a delegation to Jerusalem to provide spiritual leadership for the former captives who were rebuilding the temple and the city
Ezra found strength and courage in knowing that the Lord was with them each step of the way
'So I was encouraged, as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me; and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me'
When we see the Lord's hand in our lives, it brings forth a deep 'Thank You'
and a growing desire to do what He wants us to do.
The radio engineers who work at RBC Ministries were getting ready to broadcast a program via satellite
They had prepared everything, including the satellite link
But just as they were to begin uploading, the signal to the satellite was lost
Confused, the engineers labored to reconnect the link, but nothing worked
Then they got the word the satellite was gone, Literally
The satellite had suddenly and surprisingly fallen from the sky
It was no longer there
I suspect that sometimes when we pray, we think something similar has happened to God that for some reason He isn't there
But the Bible offers us comfort with the assurance that God hasn't 'fallen from the sky.'
He is always available to us
He hears and He cares
In a time of desperation, David wrote, 'Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry aloud, and He shall hear my voice'
No matter when we call on God, He hears the cries of His children
That should encourage our hearts
What was David's response to having a God who hears prayer
'Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you'
Although God may not answer as we would like or when we would like, we know that at 'evening and morning and at noon'
He is always there.
Got Botox
A lot of people do
Some take Botox treatments for health matters, but many take them because they want to look young again
Appearance is so important to some Botox users that they allow themselves to be injected with botulinum toxin type A so that their wrinkles will disappear for a while
Later, the treatment must be administered again
Botox is expensive, and it comes with possible negative side effects
But that doesn't stop people from giving it a try so they can look better
Of course, looking good is not a bad thing, but a more important consideration is how we look on the inside
How much are we willing to sacrifice to have beautiful character
Are we willing to take some 'Botox for the soul' to inject ourselves with the kind of loving gentleness, merciful patience, caring interest in others, unselfish kindness, and unity of spirit that can beautify our lives
Are we willing to keep coming back to God for help in getting the spiritual character enhancement we need
Looking for ways to look good
Search the Bible for character-building verses
Then through prayer and the Spirit's empowering, inject the godly traits of those verses into your life
The side effects are all good.
Five-year-old Jenna was not having a good start to her day
Every attempt to arrange the world according to her liking was having the opposite result
Arguing didn't work
Pouting didn't work
Crying didn't work
Finally her mother reminded her of the Bible verse she had been learning: 'Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You'
Apparently Jenna had been thinking about this verse, because she was quick to answer: 'But Mom, it doesn't say that I won't sin; it says that I might not sin.'
Her words are all too familiar
I often hear similar arguments in my own mind
There's something very appealing about loopholes, and we look for them wherever there's a command we don't want to obey
Jesus addressed this problem with religious leaders who thought they had found a loophole in their religious laws
Instead of honoring their parents with financial or material support, they dedicated all their possessions to God, thereby limiting their use
Although their disobedience was not blatant, Jesus said their behavior was unacceptable
Whenever we start looking for loopholes, we stop being obedient.
Our world has become increasingly noisy
But according to a news report, science has found a way to achieve absolute silence: 'Scientists have shown off the blueprint for an '\sacoustic cloak,' which could make objects impervious to sound waves
The technology, outlined in the New Journal of Physics, could be used to build sound-proof homes, advanced concert halls, or stealth warships.'
When we seek out a quiet place for devotional time with God, we may wish we had an 'acoustic cloak.'
But even if we could silence all external sound, the internal noises of worry would still reverberate in our minds
We are told: 'Be still, and know that I am God'
But how do we calm our hearts in practical terms
God understands our dilemma and has provided His own 'acoustic cloak' to quiet our hearts
It involves exchanging our cares for His peace
'Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 
the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus'
As we place our concerns in God's capable hands, we find a quietness that only He can provide.
During a church leaders' conference at Seattle Pacific University, noted pastor Earl Palmer recalled an experience that shaped his teaching and preaching for half a century
As a seminary student, he led a Bible study where he encouraged the participants to consider the words of Scripture
'I became convinced,' Palmer said, 'that if I could get someone to look at the text, sooner or later the text would win their respect, and it would always point them to its living center: Jesus Christ
And when Jesus Christ has your respect, that's not very many inches away from faith.'
Jesus told a group of religious leaders, who were well acquainted with the Old Testament but violently opposed to Him, 'You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; 
and these are they which testify of Me
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
It requires an open heart as well as an inquiring mind to study the Bible
When we discover Jesus as the Person to whom the entire Bible points, we must then decide how to respond to Him
There is great joy for all who will open their hearts to Christ and find life in Him.
Lauren nervously yet excitedly hopped into a one-person kayak for a white-water rafting experience
After strapping herself in, she headed down the river with a group of kayakers and guides
Lauren became even more nervous when she laid eyes on the falls ahead
Suddenly, as the kayak tossed and turned in the white water, it flipped over
She had been instructed on how to get out quickly if this were to happen
But she became disoriented as she hung upside-down in the water and couldn't find the release bar to get out
She knew she couldn't hold her breath much longer and thought she would soon be in the Lord's presence
Then help came just in time and she was saved
Lauren was very grateful for her rescue from physical death
An even greater rescue has been provided for us rescue from spiritual death has come in the Person of Jesus Christ
While we were drowning in sin, God sent His Son Jesus to bring life through His own death and resurrection
He did so because He is 'rich in mercy' and because of 'His great love'
Out of gratefulness, we can help others by telling them of the Rescuer they so desperately need.
During the high schoolers' spring ministry trip to Jamaica, they visited a home for troubled teens who had run afoul of the law or whose families could not handle them
This was not a comfortable situation for the kids from either culture
What would they say
How would they connect
It didn't take long to find out
Minutes after they arrived, a soccer match began as a number of the US students engaged some of the Jamaican teens in spirited competition
The soccer match was a great icebreaker as the kids kicked the ball around and got to know each other
After the game, conversation was easier and friendships were established more quickly because of a common interest
In Acts 17, the apostle Paul demonstrated how to break through barriers and establish dialogue
He talked with the Athenians about something of common interest worship
In a similar way, we can use sports talk with a co-worker or lawn conversation with a neighbor
The possibilities are endless
To reach out to people who need to hear about God's love, look for common language and watch the barriers fall.
Robert Lowry felt that preaching would be his greatest contribution in life
However, this 19th-century pastor is best remembered for his gospel music and hymns
Lowry composed words or music for more than 500 songs, including 'Christ Arose,' 'I Need Thee Every Hour,' and 'Shall We Gather at the River'
In 1860, as the United States teetered on the brink of civil war, Lowry wrote these enduring words that focus not on threatening circumstances but on the unchanging Christ:
What though my joys and comforts die
The Lord my Savior liveth
What though the darkness gather round
Songs in the night He giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm 
While to that refuge clinging
Since Christ is Lord of Heav'n and earth
How can I keep from singing
Lowry's confidence in God during difficult times echoes the psalmist's words:
'Do not put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God'
Whether we react to life with faith or fear depends on our focus
Knowing that 'the Lord shall reign forever' , how can we keep from singing?
When the Pharisees came to Jesus with the woman caught in adultery and asked Him what should be done with her, He knelt for a moment and scribbled in the sand
We have no idea what He wrote
But when they continued asking Him, Jesus responded in one short sentence: 'He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first'
His few words accomplished much in confronting the Pharisees with their own sin, for they walked away one by one
Even today those words resound around the world
Jesus had such a closeness to and dependence on His Father that He said of Himself, 'Whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak'
Oh, that we had such a relationship with our Father that we knew how to respond with His wisdom
Perhaps it begins with obeying James' challenge to be 'swift to hear, slow to speak'
This is not the slowness of ignorance, emptiness, timidity, guilt, or shame
But the slowness of wisdom born of dwelling quietly on the Lord and His thoughts
We're often told to stop and think before we speak
But I think we should take it much further and live a life where we're always listening for God's wisdom.
Everything was quiet in our yard
While I worked at the patio table, our dog, Maggie, lay nearby in the grass
A slight rustling of dry leaves changed everything
Maggie made her move, and suddenly she was circling a tree, where a woodchuck clung tightly to the trunk
Maggie came when I called, but I couldn't get her to look at me
Her neck was in a rigidly fixed position
Although she was near me physically, her thoughts and desires were with that woodchuck
Maggie and the woodchuck remind me of how quickly I become preoccupied with things that take my eyes off Jesus
Old temptations, new responsibilities, or ongoing desires for possessions or pleasure can quickly divert my attention from the One who knows and wants what is best for me
A similar spiritual condition afflicted the Pharisees
They were serving in the temple and instructing others, but their hearts were far from God
We too can teach and serve at church but be far from God
Even our religious activity becomes meaningless when our focus is not on Jesus
But if we stop being 'stiff-necked'
, the Lord can turn our eyes away from worthless things and revive our hearts.
We know we're getting older when we say things like, 'Can you believe how young those professional baseball players are?'
And it's a sure sign of aging when we no longer ask, 'How are you?'
but say, 'Hey, you look terrific'?, as if we're surprised
Aging is inevitable
Unfortunately, society has taught us to fear advancing age and to disguise its reality as much as possible
But aging can actually be a wonderful thing
Followers of Jesus have the capacity to get significantly better with age
As Paul put it: 'Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day'
Just as there are physical signs that reveal we're getting older, there are signs that show we are getting better
Rather than becoming more crotchety, intolerant, and unloving, the maturing follower of Jesus grows better at forgiving, loving, and caring
Growing older is a continuation of the journey to become more like Jesus, which means that as time goes on our heart and attitudes should increasingly resonate with and reflect the compelling character and winsome ways of our Savior
So as we grow older, let's embrace the opportunity to become spiritually more like Jesus
Our friends will notice that we look better with age.
Diana and Dave love to ride their jet skis on the lake, skimming across the water on warm sunny days
But one morning the weather was cool and mostly cloudy, and Diana couldn't convince Dave to go out
So she went on her own
It was so cold that she flitted back and forth across the lake, trying to keep herself in the sunshine for some needed warmth
But every time she reached a sunny area, the clouds moved and it quickly turned to shade
Realizing the futility and silliness of chasing the sunshine, she finally gave up because it didn't bring her what she wanted
King Solomon did another kind of chasing that couldn't bring him satisfaction
In the first 11 verses of Ecclesiastes 2 alone, he mentions that he chased after pleasure, laughter, wine, wisdom, houses, gardens, money, possessions, and music
But his evaluation was that 'all was vanity and grasping for the wind
There was no profit under the sun'
Those pursuits were empty 'vanity of vanities'
He wisely concluded: 'Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man's all'
Are you chasing after some of the same things that Solomon was
It's a vain pursuit
Purpose and satisfaction come only from knowing and obeying God.
A poet once wrote: 'As a rule, man's a fool
When it's hot, he wants it cool
And when it's cool, he wants it hot
Always wanting what is not.'
What an insightful observation on human nature
So when we read in Philippians 4:11, 'I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content'
we wonder, Can this be possible
For Paul it was
Philippians 4:12-13 describes Paul's response to life: 'I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty
I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want
I can do everything through Him who gives me strength'
Paul's relationship with God superseded whatever he did or did not have
His contentment was not based on his circumstances, but on his relationship with Christ
Paul reminds us that contentment doesn't happen overnight
It's something that we learn
As our relationship with God develops over time and through experiences, we learn to trust God more and ourselves less
Paul knew that Christ would give him the strength to persevere in whatever situation he encountered
No matter what you're facing today, through prayer you can receive the strength to be content.
Addie was a bit worried
Before we all sat down for Sunday dinner, someone had started eating
That's when our 3-year-old granddaughter said, 'We haven't prayed yet.'
She was concerned that we might forget to give thanks
Her concern was a good sign
It showed that at her young age, Addie was beginning to form one of those good habits that parents teach their children as part of their instructions for life
This little routine, for instance, helps her see the value of prayer and thanksgiving, which can be a powerful resource for her in the years ahead
Raising children in an age of hostility toward the Christian faith is not easy
Parents wonder how best to help their little ones learn to trust the Savior and live to please Him
Proverbs indicates that a key to directing children is through purposeful instruction by parents on such things as listening to wisdom , seeking discernment , understanding the fear of the Lord , recalling parents' teaching , and gaining insight
These become habitual when parents give instruction and when children 'retain'
those words of teaching
Got kids or grandkids
It's never too early to begin instructing them in wise living.
The Narnia children's books written by C S Lewis symbolize Christian truth
In the tale Prince Caspian, Lewis tells the story of a tyrant who usurped the throne of the enchanted land of Narnia
His young nephew, Prince Caspian, has heard stories of Narnia's great king who died and rose again to break the power of evil
His uncle dismisses this story as a fairy tale
However, the boy later discovers that the ancient story is in fact true
Lewis' intent was to illustrate how skeptics often dismiss the ancient story of Christ as a myth
But, like biblical scholars today, Lewis was convinced that based on the historic evidence, the record of Jesus' supernatural life is true
Sir Frederic Kenyon, former director of the British Museum, held a similar conviction about Scripture's reliability
Of this he wrote, 'Both the authenticity and the general integrity of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as established.'
The apostles had the same confidence in the record of Jesus: 'We did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty'
We can be assured that the biblical account of the King of kings is an accurate historical record.
When people say with a sigh, 'Promises, promises,'
it's often when they've been disappointed by someone who failed to keep a commitment
The more it happens, the greater the sadness and the deeper the sigh
Have you ever felt that God doesn't keep His promises
It's an attitude that can subtly develop over time
After God promised Abraham, 'I will make you a great nation'
, 25 years elapsed before the birth of his son Isaac
During that period, Abraham questioned God about his lack of a child , and he even resorted to fathering a son through his wife's handmaiden
Yet, through the ups and downs, God kept reminding Abraham of His promise to give him a child, while urging him to walk faithfully with Him and believe
When we claim one of God's promises in the Bible, whether it is for peace of mind, courage, or provision of our needs, we place ourselves in His hands and on His schedule
As we wait, it may at times seem as if the Lord has forgotten us
But trust embraces the reality that when we stand on a promise of God, He remains faithful
The assurance is in our hearts, and the timing is in His hands.
While browsing through some birthday cards in a gift shop, I found one that made me laugh
Its message read: 'You are only young once, but you can be immature forever.'
That card tickled my funny bone
There is something winsome about never having to grow up, as any fan of Peter Pan can attest
But we all know that perpetual immaturity is not only inappropriate, it's also unacceptable
For the Christian, it's vital that we mature
After we are born again and become followers of Christ, we are not expected to stay spiritual babies
The Scriptures challenge us to grow to be more like Him
When writing to the church at Corinth a church with many problems Paul said that their issues were rooted in a lack of spiritual development
In 1 Corinthians 3:1, he said, 'I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.'
How do we grow beyond being just spiritual babes
Peter urged, 'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
We do this by meditating on the Word of God and devoting ourselves to prayer
Like the troubled church of Corinth, it may be time for us to grow up.
Mozart is revered as a genius of musical composition
In one instance, he was even inspired by the melody of a bird
Mozart had a pet starling whose song so fascinated him that some say he wrote a piece of music based on the melody he heard in the bird's chirps
Birds were also an inspiration to the psalmist
In Psalm 104, he praises God for caring for the living creatures He put on the earth
Included in his observations are birds who fly in the heavens above, perch in the branches of trees, and sing songs of heartfelt joy: 'The birds of the heavens have their home; they sing among the branches'
Nature filled the psalmist's heart with praise to God, and I think that must have included the musical sounds of the birds
Often the marvels we see in creation prompt us to worship
This theme is repeated throughout Scripture: 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork'
Creation's stimulus to praise need not be limited to the visual
It can also be widened to include hearing nature's songs
As we go about our daily routine, we can tune our hearts to the melodies God has placed in His creatures and let them serve as an added springboard of praise to the Creator.
Summer is my favorite season
I love the leisurely days when I can set aside some of my routines without feeling guilty
Doing new things, seeing new places, and allowing myself the time to take 'the scenic route' revive my spirit and renew my enthusiasm for life and work
But summer can also be a dangerous time of breaking good habits
Certain routines are good
They increase our efficiency and ensure that important things get done
After all, we need to have fixed times and places for certain things or the world would be chaotic
Creation is designed to operate on schedule, and, as part of it, so are we
We need food and sleep at regular intervals
We sometimes hear legitimate warnings about allowing routines to turn into ruts
But the Bible indicates that having set times for certain things is good
David indicated that morning was the right time for him to praise God and ask for His direction
And Daniel prayed three times a day, and not even the threat of death made him change his routine
While enjoying carefree days, we must not become careless about spending time with God
Savoring spiritual sustenance is a routine for all seasons.
A few years ago, the banking empire Citicorp ran a series of billboards about money: 'Money changes hands just be sure it doesn't change the rest of you!'
and 'If people say you're made of money, you should work on your personality!'
These ads gave a refreshingly new perspective on riches
God also has a surprising spin on wealth
From His perspective, you can be 'well off'
when it comes to worldly treasures and yet be in dire poverty in your soul
Or you can be poor in terms of earthside stuff and be lavishly rich by God's standards
The distorting power of wealth reminds me of the story of the rich young ruler
After a discussion about eternal life, Jesus asked him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him
Unfortunately, the man 'went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions'
This prompted Jesus' lesson to the disciples: 'How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!'
It's not that Jesus is against wealth
It's just that He is grieved by anything that we value more than Him
We can work hard and make money, but when those things are the main pursuit of life, then Jesus isn't
Placing Him first and foremost in our lives is the key to true prosperity.
You have to work hard to offend Christians
By nature, Christians are the most forgiving, understanding, and thoughtful group of people I've ever dealt with
They never assume the worst
They appreciate the importance of having different perspectives
They're slow to anger, quick to forgive, and almost never make rash judgments or act in anything less than a spirit of total love
No, wait I'm thinking of Labrador retrievers
I laughed when I read this humorous thought by David Learn in an e-mail
But having had experience with retrievers and fellow Christians I think it's true that sometimes believers are just too easily offended
'The choir director always gives her the solos.'
'The pastor didn't even look at me when he shook my hand.'
'I do a lot around here people ought to appreciate me a little more.'
Anger Resentment Pride
Sure, issues between believers do sometimes need to be addressed
But what if we always tried to treat others the way we want to be treated , weren't quick to judge others but forgave them , and demonstrated a little humility
And what if the world could actually recognize that we are followers of Jesus by the love we have 'for one another'?
Is this true of us?
Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina is a spectacular waterfall system of 275 falls along 2.7 km of the Iguazu River
Etched on a wall on the Brazilian side of the Falls are the words of Psalm 93:4, 'Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty!'
Below it are these words, 'God is always greater than all of our troubles.'
The writer of Psalm 93, who penned its words during the time that kings reigned, knew that God is the ultimate King over all
'The Lord reigns,' he wrote
'Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting'
No matter how high the floods or waves, the Lord remains greater than them all
The roar of a waterfall is truly majestic, but it is quite a different matter to be in the water hurtling toward the falls
That may be the situation you are in today
Physical, financial, or relational problems loom ever larger and you feel like you are about to go over the falls
In such situations, the Christian has Someone to turn to
He is the Lord, 'who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think'
for He is greater than all of our troubles.
My wife and I don't always under- stand each other
For instance, it's a great mystery to her how I can watch an entire baseball game between two teams that have no chance of making the playoffs
And I surely don't understand her love of shopping
To love someone intensely doesn't mean you have to understand him or her completely
That's good news, because there's no way we can begin to grasp the deep mysteries of the God we love
With our finite minds and our self-centered views, we can't deduce why God does what He does
Yet some people look at tragedies, for instance, and turn their backs on God assuming that their finite knowledge about the situation is better than His infinite wisdom
Indeed, if we could figure God out if He were no more than a glorified human with no greater knowledge than that of the smartest person where would be the awe and the majesty of the Almighty
One reason we know God to be so great is that we cannot reduce His thinking to ours
The apostle Paul asked, 'Who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?'
Clearly, the answer is no one
Praise God that even when we don't understand Him, we know we can trust Him.
Long ago my wife decided that driving within the speed limit gives her a wonderful sense of freedom
She tells me, 'I don't ever need a radar detector
And I never have to slow down when I see a state patrol car or worry about paying a fine for speeding.'
Even on long trips when the miles seem to grind slowly along, she sets the cruise control at the posted speed limit and enjoys the journey
'Besides,' she reminds me, 'it is the law.'
Romans 13:1-10 addresses our responsibility to the authority of human government and to the law of God
When we obey the governing authorities, we don't have to fear punishment, and we gain a clear conscience by doing what is right
Paul urged the followers of Christ in Rome to give the governing authorities what was owed them, whether taxes, revenue, respect, or honor
But he went beyond human regulations when he wrote: 'Owe no one anything except to love one another
for he who loves another has fulfilled the law'
It is our duty to obey man's law and our privilege to fulfill God's law by loving others
And His law is 'the perfect law that gives freedom'
When I heard that David was in the office for a board meeting, I was excited
He and I had a mutual friend, Sharon, who had died several years earlier
We had a few minutes to reminisce about her and her love for life and God
What a delight to connect with someone who has loved someone you have loved
There's a special bond because you love to talk about that cherished person
Those who know Jesus Christ as their Savior have even stronger ties
We are forever connected to Him and to one another
'We, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another,'
Paul says in Romans 12:5
We've been 'born of God,'
and we love those who are 'begotten of Him'
When we get together with fellow believers, we have the opportunity to talk about the one we love Christ and of the love, forgiveness, and grace we have experienced in Him because of His death and resurrection
At such times, we can encourage each other to continue to trust Him and spur one another on to be faithful in our walk with Him
This coming Sunday and throughout the week, let's remind fellow believers of all that Jesus has done and of how truly wonderful He is.
As we sat at the table one day last week, my oldest son began protesting about his little sister 'always' copying him
When she imitates his laugh or eats her French fries before her burger like he does, it annoys him
My wife and I tried to get him to realize that he has an opportunity to influence her by setting a good example
Unlike my son, Paul invited others to copy his example
In this verse, he concluded his discussion from chapter 10 about the Corinthians loving others enough to limit their freedom
He said that when they were invited to a nonbeliever's home for dinner, they were free to eat what was set before them
But if their freedom to eat the meat offered to idols caused another believer to question whether or not what they were doing was right, they were to limit their freedom for the good of the 'weaker' believer
Paul encouraged the people to follow his example in this matter, in the same way he followed Christ's example
Paul did not seek his own good, but the good of others by imitating Jesus' example of love, unity, acceptance, and sacrifice
In the same way, we are to follow Jesus' example so closely that we can say with confidence to our brothers and sisters, 'Copy me as I copy Christ.'?
Think about how good it will feel when it stops hurting,' said my father
I received this advice from Dad often while I was growing up, usually after some minor bump or scrape had resulted in a major dramatic reaction
At the time, the advice didn't help
I was incapable of focusing on anything other than my pain, and loud wails accompanied by buckets of tears seemed the only appropriate response
Through the years, however, Dad's advice has pulled me through some truly miserable situations
Whether it was the pain of a broken heart or the misery of a drawn-out illness, I would remind myself: Now is not forever
The confidence we have as Christians is that God has something good planned for us
Suffering was not part of His original act of creation, but it serves as a temporary reminder of what happens in a world where God's order has been broken
It also motivates us to spread the word about God's plan to redeem the world from the suffering caused by sin
Although we cannot avoid pain and disappointment , we know that it's only temporary
Some sorrow will be relieved in this life, but all of it will be relieved when God finally and firmly establishes His new heaven and new earth
Now is not forever.
Isaac Hann was a little-known pastor 
He served a small church in Loughwood, England, in the mid-18th century
At the close of his ministry, the membership of the church numbered 26 women and 7 men
And only 4 of the men attended with any regularity
In this age of mass media and mega-churches, who would consider this a successful work
In our world today, Isaac Hann would be considered one of those pastors who never quite 'made it.'
He certainly wouldn't have been invited to speak at pastors' conferences
He would not have written articles on church growth
Yet, when he died at 88 his parishioners placed a plaque on the wall of their meeting house
The plaque remains to this day
It reads in part: Few ministers so humble were, yet few so much admired: Ripened for heaven by grace divine, like autumn fruit he fell;  Reader think not to live so long, but seek to live as well
First Peter 5:5-6 comes to mind: 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.'
Reverend Isaac Hann 'made it big'
in a way that matters humility before God and a reward in heaven
We can too.
During one of my daily walks, I inadvertently walked through a small tornado of little insects
I didn't think much of it at the time, but later on I found all kinds of bites on my ankles and arms
It seems I had walked through a swarm of gnats, whose bites led to uncomfortable itching and sores
This experience gave me a new perspective on the plague of gnats that God visited upon Egypt when Pharaoh would not free the Israelites
The Hebrew word translated 'lice' in Exodus 8:16-18 can also mean 'gnats' or 'mosquitoes.'
Because the insects are compared to the sand of the desert, a swarm of gnats seems the most likely
The pagan priests of Pharaoh who prided themselves in their frequent washings and shavings were now covered with numerous insect bites
God had designed this plague to get Pharaoh to repent and let Israel go, but instead he hardened his heart
Is God trying to get your attention through some circumstances in your life
Is He trying to persuade you to get back in step with Him
We should resist the urge to harden our hearts
But let's instead submit to God and ask Him what spiritual lessons He wants us to learn.
Recently I was in a crowded shopping area when I saw a woman plowing her way through the crowd
What intrigued me was the message on her T-shirt, which read in bold capital letters, IT'S ALL ABOUT ME
Her actions reinforced the words on her shirt
I'm afraid she's not alone
That message is declared by so many men and women today that it could be the motto of our modern world
For followers of Christ, however, that statement simply is not true
It is not all about us it's all about Jesus Christ and others
The apostle Paul certainly felt the weight of this reality
He was so concerned that his fellow Israelites would know Christ that he said, 'I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my countrymen according to the flesh'
That is a remarkable statement
Far from thinking it was all about himself, Paul affirmed that he would willingly exchange his eternity for theirs
Paul's teaching is a refreshing reminder of self-sacrifice in a challenging world that is destructively self-centered
The question we must ask is: Is it all about me
Or is our life about Jesus Christ and the people He came to reach
Think about it
What's it all about?
During a January research trip to Germany, I was dismayed to learn that we would be staying at a monastery
I pictured an austere place with no heat, cold stone floors, and hard beds
Instead, I found a warm, welcoming, comfortable room
My colleague said, 'The monks believe in treating their guests as they would treat Christ.'
Though they don't live in such comfort themselves, they are content
Robert Herrick, a 17th-century English poet, wrote: Christ, He requires still, wheresoe'er He comes, To feed, or lodge, to have the best of rooms: Give Him the choice; grant Him the nobler part Of all the house: the best of all's the heart
It may seem easier to welcome Christ into our heart than to open our life to others
Whether it's a room in our home or time in our schedule, too often we treat people as intruders rather than guests
The apostle Peter wrote: 'Above all things have fervent love for one another, for '\slove will cover a multitude of sins.'
Be hospitable to one another without grumbling'
We honor Christ by giving Him the best room, our hearts, and by offering willing hospitality to others.
In March 2009, a 62-year-old woman was charged with stealing more than $73,000 from her church in the state of Washington
When the detectives interrogated her, she told them: 'Satan had a big part in the theft.'
It sounds like she was saying that the devil made her do it
Satan may have played a role in her choices, but she has some faulty thinking about temptation and sin
The devil tempts believers, but he doesn't make us sin
James tells us that God isn't to blame either: 'Let no one say when he is tempted, '\sI am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone'
He is good and holy
So who is to blame for our sin
James says, 'Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed'
Just as a fisherman uses bait to lure his prey, so our own evil, unchecked desires lead to giving in to temptation and sin
When we disobey God by sinning, let's not shift the blame or justify our actions with the faulty 'the devil made me do it' theology
Instead, let's take full responsibility for our actions, confess our sins to a gracious and forgiving Father, and pursue right living again.
I still find it amazing that we can launch probes into deep space
But think of how wasteful it would be if on the way to Mars our probe got caught in the gravitational pull of a lesser, insignificant object
Beware, That might be happening in our lives
When Jesus called His disciples to follow Him, He meant for them to begin a journey to passionately pursue Him
Followers of Christ have been launched into a trajectory that is defined by drawing closer and closer to Him
But in the process, we are often distracted and succumb to the gravitational pull of lesser, alluring things
When that happens, we cease our pursuit of Him and go into orbit around stuff that in the end is empty and unsatisfying
Psalm 63 is the cure for lives stuck in orbit
David pursued God, knowing that He alone could satisfy his inner longings because His 'lovingkindness is better than life'
The joy of God's presence consumed every moment: 'When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches'
David understood that true joy and purpose come not in admiring God from a safe distance, but from chasing hard after Him
Let's get back on track and pursue an increasingly closer walk with God!
The H1N1 pandemic focused the world's attention on viruses
Viruses are living organisms that need a host to survive and wreak their havoc
In some cases, a virus can be present for many years before the host is even aware of it
During that time, the virus can inflict widespread and untold damage
Take it away from the host, and it remains dormant or dies
In a similar way, sin needs a host to stay alive
By themselves, sins such as pride, greed, anger, and selfishness are mere words
But when sin overpowers a human host, it works to destroy it for as long as the host is alive
Thankfully, because of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, Christians have been positionally 'set free from sin'
Even though we still sin, the Holy Spirit who lives in us helps us to resist that 'sin virus,' the lust of the flesh
The apostle John tells us: 'Those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning, because God's life is in them'
Now we walk in dependence upon the Spirit, and one day we will stand 'faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy'
Isn't that a great comfort for you as you step out today into a world infected by the 'virus' of sin
A friend who is a commercial pilot told me about a flight in which he encountered a serious mechanical issue, a problem with dangerous implications
When the situation occurred, the warning lights in the cockpit informed him of the problem
and he monitored it all the way to the destination, ultimately landing safely
Once on the ground, the pilot immediately went to the maintenance staff and reported it
To his surprise, the mechanics responded, 'We already know about the problem and are ready to fix it
When you got the cockpit warning, we automatically got an electronic warning as well.'
As he shared that incident, I couldn't help but compare it to Jesus' words about our heavenly Father: 'Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him'
He said this in contrast to people who believe that they must 'use vain repetitions
For they think that they will be heard for their many words'
Jesus presupposes God's knowledge of and concern for His children
Even though God knows our needs, He still wants us to share our hearts with Him
He stands ready to hear our prayer and to repair our brokenness by His grace.
I don't know about you, but I tend to enjoy getting credit when I do stuff for others
And I don't think I'm alone in appreciating thank you cards and words of gratitude
I also know, however, that there's something to be said for anonymity
This must be a good way to give, because Jesus endorsed it
That's why I was impressed with a gift that arrived anonymously on our front porch one day
We had been out of town; and when we returned, there stood several flower pots each holding a blooming sunflower
We knew the reason they were left on our doorstep on the birthday of our late daughter, Melissa, who loved sunflowers
Someone was telling us, 'We remember Mell.'
By giving anonymously, they focused completely on our family rather than on themselves
Imagine a world in which we all gave generously and selflessly
Jesus mentioned secret giving in Matthew 6
He said, 'When you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
That your charitable deed may be in secret
Realistically, we can't always give anonymously
But our giving should always be marked with the same spirit of selfless humility and God-directed charity.
On the day of His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples and showed them His hands and feet
We are told that at first they could not believe for joy it appeared too wonderful to be true
Thomas was not with the disciples, but he also had trouble believing until he saw for himself
When Jesus appeared to Thomas and told him to put his fingers in the nail holes and his hand in His side, Thomas cried, 'My Lord and my God!'
Later, as Paul told the Philippians of his own suffering, he also declared Jesus as Lord
He testified that he had come to the place where he considered all his experiences as loss 'for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord'
You and I have never seen Jesus calm a storm or raise someone from the dead
We haven't sat at His feet on a Galilean hillside and heard Him teach
But through eyes of faith we have been spiritually healed by His death on our behalf
Thus we can join Thomas and Paul and countless others in acknowledging Jesus as our Lord
Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed'
When we believe, we too can call Jesus, 'My Lord and my God!'?
The other day I ran across a troubling report about people who think it is acceptable to use the ocean as a giant garbage dump
Here is an excerpt: 'If you should see this amazing floating pile of plastic in the Pacific Ocean, it's called '\sThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch.' 
It features three million tons of plastic debris floating in an area larger than Texas
An eye-popping 46,000 pieces of plastic float on every square mile of ocean!'
Other sources estimate the amount of garbage is even bigger
Plastic is especially bad because it does not dissolve
During our sojourn on earth, we have been charged, like Adam, with taking care of the earth and its creatures that God has given us
Genesis 2:15 says, 'The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.'
God delights in what He has made and this extends to the sea and all that live in it
This world should remind us of the greatness of our Creator and serve as a springboard of praise to Him
Indifferently using it as a garbage dump mars its beauty and threatens the creatures that live here
Showing respect and caring for the land, the ocean, and the air is our duty as believers in Christ.
I was excited about going to the baseball park to watch the Detroit Tigers play the Chicago White Sox
I proudly put on my Tigers T-shirt that morning before going to the opposing team's stadium
But I had to wear a sweatshirt over my team's shirt because it was cool outside
So I was disappointed that no one at U.S
Cellular Field could see which team I was there to cheer for
No one knew I was a Tigers' fan
After a 3-hour rain delay, the game finally started and I could cheer for my team and get my loyalty out in the open
The apostle Paul had a loyalty that was most definitely out in the open a loyalty to Jesus Christ
He wrote to the believers in Rome, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ'
He knew that the gospel was 'the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes'
because Jesus had dramatically changed his life and its direction
In his preaching and witnessing, he proclaimed Jesus, the One to whom he had given his whole life
The believers in Rome were also known for their allegiance to Christ
Paul said of them: 'Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world'
Is your loyalty to Jesus out in the open?
If you've ever tried to fix something and failed, you'll appreciate the sign I saw outside an automotive repair shop: We Will Fix What Your Husband Fixed
Whether the problem is the car, the plumbing, or an appliance, it's usually better off in the hands of someone who is skilled and trustworthy
So it is with the sin and the struggles within us that resist our efforts to mend them
Jeremiah denounced the greedy prophets and priests of his day who 'healed the hurt of [God's] people slightly, saying '\sPeace, peace!' when there is no peace'
They could neither change themselves nor lead the people to spiritual transformation
So the Lord called the people to follow His way: 'Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls'
Centuries later, Jesus, the Son of God, said: 'Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest'
The parts of our lives that we have tried and failed to repair can be restored by the hand of God
Through faith in Christ, we can be made whole.
When young Kofi came home after Sunday school, his mother asked him what he had learned that morning
His quick reply spoke volumes: 'Obedience again!'
Although I'm many years older than Kofi, I agree that obedience to God is a lesson that we must, sometimes reluctantly, learn over and over again
Oswald Chambers wrote: 'The Lord does not give me rules, but He makes His standard very clear
If my relationship to Him is that of love, I will do what He says
If I hesitate, it is because I love someone I have placed in competition with Him, namely, myself.'
When we are obedient, we show God that we love Him and have more faith in Him than we do in ourselves
Arthur W
Pink said that love is 'a principle of action, and it expresses itself
by deeds which please the object loved.'
To obey God means to relinquish what we want and to choose to do what He asks
God requires the obedience of His followers, and Jesus placed great importance on it
He asked, 'Why do you call Me '\sLord, Lord,' and not do the things which I say?'
And He issued this challenge: 'If you love Me, keep My commandments'
Erin's life was so different from that of most 8-year-olds
While other kids were running and playing and eating ice cream, Erin was lying in a bed being fed through a tube, able to see only the brightest lights and hear only the loudest sounds
Her life consisted of needles and nurses and hospital visits as she battled ongoing illnesses and profound disabilities
Surrounded by a remarkable family who cared for her with compassion and filled her life with love, Erin died before reaching her ninth birthday
What can be learned from a precious child like Erin, one who never spoke a word or colored a picture or sang a song
A friend of Erin's family put it best: 'We are all better for having had Erin in our lives
She taught us compassion, unconditional love, and appreciation for the little things.'
Children such as Erin also remind us that this world is not reserved for the perfect, the wealthy, or the athletic
Each person, no matter their physical, mental, or emotional condition, is created in the image of God and is of equal value and significance
Our Lord has compassion for the weak, the broken, and all He has made , and we should mirror that concern
Is there an 'Erin'
in your life you can learn from?
Over and over again, my driver's education instructor said these two words: 'Drive ahead.'
This was his way of telling me to focus on the horizon, not just on my immediate surroundings
Drivers who continually look to the right or to the left may well go into the ditch
Satan is good at causing 'roadside distractions'
that tempt us to look at him rather than at Jesus
If he can get our attention, he may be able to get us off track and delay our spiritual progress
He even tried this with Jesus Himself
After Jesus was baptized, Satan tried to deter Him by suggesting 'better'
ways to accomplish His work
Satan told Jesus that He could prove He was the Son of God by throwing Himself from the temple
But Jesus knew that proving He was God's Son would come by submitting Himself to the cross, not by flinging Himself from a high building
He responded, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God'
Jesus had His eyes on our redemption, and He knew He couldn't accomplish it by taking a detour around the cross
The way to stay out of spiritual ditches is to fix our eyes on Jesus and refuse to even glance at Satan's distractions.
The book The Preacher and the Presidents chronicles the ministry of evangelist Billy Graham
Spanning presidents from Harry S
Truman to George W
Bush, Graham often had an open door to the White House
Yet despite his unusual sphere of influence, Graham repeatedly credited the grace of God working through him for his influence, not any personal talent he might possess
The apostle Paul was another believer who was called to witness to people in high authority
Christ said of Paul, 'He is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel'
In Acts, we read that Paul's sphere of influence included rulers such as Felix, Festus, Herod Agrippa, and perhaps Caesar himself
But as Billy Graham would do centuries later, Paul pointed to the grace of God working through him: 'Not I, but the grace of God which was with me'
You may not be called to proclaim the gospel to heads of state, but God has placed people in your life with whom He wants you to share His message of hope
Why not pray for opportunities for God's grace to flow through you as a witness to someone in your sphere of influence?
While walking through a home-improvement store, I saw a man wearing a bright red T-shirt bearing this melancholy message: 'Confidence: The feeling you have just before you understand the situation.'
I laughed at this humorous concept, but I also realized that the shirt carried a sane and sound warning
It's a reminder to all of us who try to get things done through confidence in our own ability or credentials but without consciously trusting in the strength of God
If we think we can accomplish life's tasks in our own strength, that false confidence will inevitably become our undoing, and we'll collapse under the weight of our own failings
Paul wrote to the Corinthians about this by recalling ancient Israel's penchant for self-confidence and self-sufficiency
He described everything the Israelites thought they had going for them; then he told how they had turned those benefits into a license to sin and an almost arrogant confidence that would prove to be their undoing
Paul said their self-confidence should warn us
His conclusion
'Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall'
Psalm 118:8 shows us the best way: 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man,'
or in ourselves
Where is your confidence?
The first people to climb Mt Everest, the world's highest mountain, were Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953
Hillary was just 33 years old
His feat afforded him fame, wealth, and the realization that he had already lived a remarkable life
So, what did Hillary do for the next 55 years
Did he retire and rest on his laurels
Absolutely not
Although Hillary had no higher mountains to climb, that didn't stop him
He achieved other notable goals, including a concerted effort to improve the welfare of the Nepalese people living near Mt
Everest, a task he carried on until his death in 2008
Did you know that God told the Levites to retire from their regular duties at age 50
But He did not want them to stop helping others
He said that they should 'minister with their brethren to attend to needs'
We cannot take this incident as a complete teaching on retirement, but we can see a godly implication that continuing to serve others after our working days are over is a good idea
Many people find that when they retire they have nothing meaningful to do with their time
But as the Levites and Sir Edmund Hillary did, we can refocus when we retire, giving of our time to help others.
When my kids were young, I thought they would be impressed with what few accomplishments I may have had, that they would read my books and be impressed by my speaking engagements
But then I discovered that they hadn't read any of my books and had no idea where I had been on a speaking gig
When my oldest son finally read one of my books, he told me that the only reason he read it was so that I would stop telling people that my children have never read my books
Let's face it, for the most part, kids are not impressed with our accomplishments
So the only way to bridge the gap is to meet them where they are, to get into their world, like getting into a game of Chutes and Ladders or playing catch in the backyard
Jesus did this with us
John said of Jesus, 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory'
In other words, He stooped down to our level when He came to this earth, which led to His greatest accomplishment of all: bridging the gap between His world and ours once and for all
Only then could we begin to understand how worthy He is of our utmost adoration and praise!
The words grace and peace are found in all of Paul's greetings in his New Testament letters to the churches
And in his letters to Timothy and Titus, he also includes mercy: 'Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord'
Let's examine each of these words
Grace is what our holy God gives that we, as sinful people, don't deserve
In Acts 17:25, we learn that 'He gives to all life, breath, and all things.' His gifts include our very next breath
Even in our darkest hour, strength is given by God so that we can endure
Mercy is what God withholds that we do deserve
In Lamentations 3:22, we read, 'Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed.'
Even when we're wayward, God gives time and help for us to turn back to Him
Peace is what God brings to His people
Jesus said: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you'
Even in the worst of times, we have inner tranquillity because our God is in control
We can be encouraged that throughout our lives the Lord will give us the grace, mercy, and peace we need to live for Him.
The ancient road from Jerusalem to Jericho is a narrow, treacherous path along a deep gorge in the Judean wilderness
Its name is Wadi Kelt, but it's known as the valley of the shadow, 
for this is the location that inspired David's 23rd Psalm
The place itself offers little reason to compose such a hopeful poem
The landscape is bleak, barren, and perilously steep
It's a good place for thieves, but not for anyone else
When David wrote, 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil'
, he was in a place where evil was an ever-present reality
Yet he refused to give in to fear
He wasn't expressing hope that God would abolish evil so that he could pass through safely; he was saying that the presence of God gave him the confidence to pass through difficult places without fear of being deserted by Him
In another psalm, David said that the Lord was his hope
Many claim to have hope, but only those whose hope is Christ can claim it with certainty
Hope comes not from strength, intelligence, or favorable circumstances, but from the Lord
As Maker of heaven and earth, He alone has the right to promise hope and the power to keep the promise.
After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, 47-year-old Randy Pausch returned to Carnegie Mellon University to deliver a final lecture to colleagues, students, and friends
The professor of computer science thought that perhaps 150 people might show up Instead the 400-seat auditorium was packed
For an hour, Randy opened his heart to them in a humorous, insightful, and moving farewell that was focused more on living than dying
Within weeks, the videotaped lecture had been seen by millions on the Internet and later became the seed of a bestselling book
Those facing death often have an unusually clear perspective on what is truly important in life
The apostle Paul's last farewell has inspired countless followers of Christ through the centuries
'The time of my departure is at hand,'wrote Paul
'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith'
Paul's instruction to Timothy spans the ages to challenge us as well
The letter begins and ends with God's grace and in between is a celebration of the unceasing faithfulness of God
A message from the dying can give purpose to the living
Paul's triumphant finale, 'To Him be glory forever and ever'
, is a message we can all live by.
One of our grandchildren is allergic to several kinds of foods
Milk, cheese, eggs, and ice cream are among the items she has to avoid
Even a small amount of these things is detrimental to her health
She's not alone in being required to avoid certain things in life
While her allergies are related to her physical well-being, each of us as believers in Jesus has dangers we need to stay away from to maintain spiritual health
Scripture gives us a clear indication of what we are 'allergic to' spiritually
Every kind of evil
This should cause us to think about the choices we make, because taking part in what is clearly evil is not good for our spiritual vitality
Foolish disputes and arguments
This takes discernment, for some arguments have merit in defending the faith
But those for which there is no answer or which have no bearing on truth only cause dissension
Sexual immorality
The Bible says that any sexual activity outside the boundaries of a marriage between a man and a woman is immoral
Are we willing to make the effort to steer clear of things we are spiritually 'allergic to'??
When Jesus commanded, 'Judge not,'
He was not implying that we should be naïve or imprudent
Of course we need to think critically and analytically in this world where we are often confronted with error and wrongdoing
Instead, He meant that we should not be condemning or accusing, a point Paul made eloquently: 'Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts'
Poet Robert Burns made a similar point, writing of those whose actions are in doubt: 'One point must still be greatly dark, the [motive]
Why they do it.'
No one knows another's motives
God alone can bring to light what is hidden in darkness; He alone can expose the intentions of the heart
Jesus knows the latent forces that motivate others: the cruel beginnings, the fear, the disappointment, the broken heart, the sin that is resisted
Moreover, He is working in every submissive heart to bring it to maturity
Thus in the end, quite often contrary to our expectations, He will bring praise to those He has brought to completion
The Lord alone can try the heart
Until He returns, let's ask Him to help us examine our own.
On a recent flight, I got ready to do some work
Spread out on my tray were my laptop computer, backup hard drive, iPod, and other gadgets that are part of being a 21st-century 'road warrior.'
As I worked, a young man seated beside me asked if he could make a comment
He told me how inspirational it was for him, a young man, to see someone my age so enthusiastically embracing modern technology
In spite of his intention to compliment me, I suddenly felt about 120 years old
What did he mean by 'someone my age'?
I wondered
After all, I was 'only' 57
Then I remembered Psalm 71, the psalm for folks 'my age' and beyond
It reminds us of the value of a life well lived and of the worth of lessons learned: Lessons are not just for our benefit but also for us to pass along to the next generations
The psalmist wrote, 'When I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not forsake me, until I declare Your strength to this generation, Your power to everyone who is to come'
So, maybe being 'someone my age' isn't such a bad gig
It is the privilege of 'veteran' Christ-followers to declare the strength and power of God to the younger generations
That's how we can truly be inspirational to them.
If you're like me, you love a good deal
Not just bargain shopping, but when you manage to cut a great deal for yourself without giving anything up in return
So if you can identify with these kinds of deals, you'll understand the prodigal son's scheme when he decided to return home
There were three kinds of servants in those days: day workers who were paid on a day-to-day basis; hired servants who worked long hours on the estate but lived in town with their independence intact; or bond servants who lived on the estate and gave all of themselves to serving the family
When the prodigal son hit rock bottom, it's interesting that his planned apology involved asking if he could be like a hired servant
Why not a grateful bond servant
Some commentators suggest that perhaps he was trying to negotiate a deal, a way to get a paycheck and keep his independence as well
Often we approach God like, 'I'll serve You but You can't take away my freedom.'
It may seem like a good deal at the time, but God's deal is so much better
Just like the boy's father, His arms are ready and willing to receive repentant sinners as part of His family
There could be no better deal and no better way to serve Him!
Francis Chan, in his book Crazy Love, tells of a family with an interesting Christmas tradition
On Christmas morning, the Robynson family doesn't focus on opening presents under the Christmas tree
Instead, they make pancakes and coffee, and serve the breakfast to the homeless
This is a small but creative way to show God's love and generosity to the poor
God expected this kind of generosity from His people
In Deuteronomy 15, Moses emphasized the reality of poverty and how the more affluent must deal with it
They were warned of four dangers: A hard heart, ignoring the needs of the poor
A closed hand, withholding what the poor lacked
An evil thought, hesitating or refusing to loan money to the poor because the year of canceling debts was nearing
A grudging spirit, a reluctance to satisfy the needs of the poor among them
Not only were they warned about selfishness, but more important, they were encouraged to be spontaneously generous
Among God's people, there must always be a spirit of generosity toward the poor
Let's open our hearts and our hands.
The miracles that God worked through Moses challenged the many gods of Pharaoh
Yet, in another time, there was a Pharaoh who promoted the belief in one deity
Pharaoh Akhenaten pointed to the rising and setting sun as the great deity who gave life to the earth
His religious symbol for Aton, the sun god, was represented by a single disc of light with emanating rays
Though this Pharaoh's idea came closer to the one God of the Bible, it was still idolatry
When Paul addressed the people in Athens, he was grieved by the idolatry in that city
Yet he used the people's imperfect understanding of God to point them to the God of Scripture
Of their efforts in trying to find God, Paul said: 'God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands'
In our increasingly pluralistic world, the people around us may worship a multiplicity of deities
Yet their spiritual journey need not end there
We never know when someone might be moving toward the kingdom of God
Following the example of Paul, we should respect a person's religious background, watch for spiritual receptivity, and then point him or her to the one true God of Scripture.
Just after we moved to a house in a new neighborhood, we invited my sister-in-law and her husband over for Sunday dinner
As we were greeting Sue and Ted at the door, an odd noise directed their eyes toward the kitchen
As I followed their gaze, I froze in horror
An errant hose of our old portable dishwasher was whipping about like the trunk of an angry elephant, spewing water everywhere
Sue went into action mode
Dropping her purse, she was in the kitchen before me, shutting off the water and calling for towels and a mop
We spent the first 15 minutes of their visit on our knees mopping the floor
Sue is a doer, and the world is a better place because of the doers of the world
These are the people who are always ready to pitch in, to be involved, and even to lead if necessary
Many of the doers of the world are also doers of the Word
These are the followers of Jesus who have taken the challenge of James to heart: 'Be doers of the Word, and not hearers only'
Are you doing all that you know God wants you to do
As you read God's Word, put what you've learned into practice
First hear, then do
God's blessing comes as a result of our obedience .
While making his landmark documentary about World War II, filmmaker Ken Burns and his colleagues watched thousands of hours of military footage
Scenes of the devastating Battle of Peleliu often invaded their dreams at night
Burns told Sacramento Bee reporter Rick Kushman, 'You're listening to the ghosts and echoes from an almost inexpressible past
If you do that, you put yourself into the emotional maelstrom.'
There's a price to becoming involved in the struggles of others, whether artistically or spiritually
Paul experienced this in his work of sharing the gospel: 'Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches
Who is weak without my being weak
Who is led into sin without my intense concern?'
Oswald Chambers said we enter this spiritual struggle as we 'deliberately identify ourselves with God's interests in other people'
and 'find to our amazement that we have power to keep wonderfully poised in the center of it all.'
Paul realized that God's strength is made perfect in our weakness
Jesus paid the greatest price to be involved in our world, and He strengthens us as we share His love with others.
There was a time when a certain West Coast city may have been one of the most hostile places to the gospel in America
Posters in coffee shops advertised witchcraft meetings where you could learn to cast a spell on your enemies
It was such a challenging environment for churches that they struggled to get building permits from the city council
And there was a lot of 'woe is me' talk among church leaders
Until a group of pastors began to meet to pray regularly and then decided to take the love of Jesus into their city
They started a ministry to the homeless, to those suffering with AIDS, to teens at risk
Faithfully and intentionally they brought the love of Jesus to the needs of hurting people
Before long, the city agencies started calling on them for help
Better yet, the churches started growing as people responded to the gospel in action
Which proves the point: Sometimes you've got to 'show up' before you speak up
No one really wants to hear what we have to say about the love of Jesus until they've seen it in our lives
Then even the most ardent opponents to the gospel may just be glad you're in their town, their office, or their neighborhood
And then you just might be able to tell them about Jesus.
News that a solar eclipse would take place on July 22, 2009, brought an alarming prediction
It was predicted that the eclipse would sufficiently affect gravitational pull, causing tectonic plates to 'pop a seam,'
resulting in a sizable earthquake and a subsequent devastating tsunami in Japan
The US Geological Survey responded that no scientists 'have ever predicted a major earthquake
They do not know how, and they do not expect to know how, anytime in the foreseeable future.'
There have also been many false predictions about the date of Christ's second coming, despite our Lord's emphatic words: 'But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only'
Christ told His followers that instead of trying to predict the date of His return, they should 'watch' and 'be ready'
Peter warned, 'The day of the Lord will come like a thief.'
Then he added: 'What kind of people ought you to be You ought to live holy and godly lives'
Striving to live for God, that's what Jesus wants us to focus our energy on while we wait for that 'blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ'
Sometimes I wonder why God didn't list the Ten Commandments in reverse order, since the 10th commandment correlates to the first sin, desire
Eve's sin wasn't simply her desire for a piece of fruit; it was the desire for knowledge that Satan told her would make her like God
Eve's covetousness caused her to violate both the first and tenth commands that God later gave to Moses
When we don't covet, we pretty much eliminate our reasons to disobey the other commands
Wanting what isn't ours causes us to lie, steal, commit adultery, murder, and refuse to honor our parents
We refuse to rest because we can't get what we want in 6 days of work
We misuse God's name when we use it to justify something that we want to do
We make gods out of wealth and relationships because we don't want to have to put all our trust in God
I have a hard time coming up with sins that don't involve some form of covetousness
Yet because it's the last in the list, we tend to think of it as being the least important
But it's not
When we stop sin while it is still in our hearts and heads, we avoid making others the victim of our sin, and we avoid many of the serious consequences of sin.
Abel doesn't seem to fit in the first half of Hebrews 11
He's the first 'ancient' listed, but his story isn't like the others mentioned there
Enoch went to heaven without dying
Noah saved mankind
Abraham started a people group
Isaac was a noted patriarch
Joseph rose to the top in Egypt
Moses led the greatest exodus ever
Clearly, their faith was rewarded
By faith, they did what God asked, and He poured out blessings on them
They saw God's promises fulfilled before their eyes
But Abel, The second son of Adam and Eve had faith, and what did he get for it Murdered
That sounds more like the folks in verses 35-38, who found that trusting God doesn't always lead to immediate blessing
They faced 'mockings,'imprisonment, and being 'sawn in two.'
'Thanks, but no thanks,' we might say
We would all prefer to be heroic Abraham instead of someone 'destitute, afflicted, tormented'
Yet in God's plan, there are no guarantees of ease and fame even for the devout
While we might experience some blessings in this life, we may also have to wait until 'something better' comes along, the completion of God's promises in Glory
Until then, let's keep living 'by faith.'?
A friend told me about his church's leadership retreat
For 2 days, church leaders pulled away for a time of prayer, planning, and worship
My friend was not only refreshed but also energized
He told me, 'This retreat is really going to help us move forward as a church ministry.'
It sounded funny to me, this notion of retreating in order to move forward
But it is true
Sometimes you have to pull back and regroup before you can make meaningful forward progress
This is particularly true in our relationship with God
Jesus Himself practiced 'retreating forward.'
After a busy day of ministry in the region of the Sea of Galilee, He retreated
Matthew 14:23 tells us that 'when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray
Now when evening came, He was alone there.'
Alone in the presence of the Father
In this fast-paced, get-ahead world, it's easy to wear ourselves down, pressing ahead and moving forward at all costs
But even in our desire to be effective Christians, we must consistently be willing to retreat into God's presence
Only in the refreshing of His strength can we find the resources to move forward in our service for Him
Retreat in Jesus before moving forward.
In 1776, the 13 British colonies in North America protested the limitations placed on them by the king of England and engaged in a struggle that gave birth to a brand-new republic
The infant nation soon adopted that now-famous document known as the Declaration of Independence
Almost 2,000 years ago, the Lord Jesus cried out on the cross, 'It is finished,' proclaiming the believer's 'declaration of independence.'
All of humanity was under the tyranny of sin and death
But Christ, the sinless One, took our place on Calvary and died for our sins
Having satisfied God's righteous demands, He now sets free for eternity all who trust in Him
Paul wrote, 'Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us'
Romans 8 assures us, 'There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death'
Galatians 5:1 urges all who have been redeemed to 'stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free.'
We are thankful to God for any freedom we enjoy in a nation
But above all, believers everywhere can praise Him for the freedom that is found in Christ!
One of my earliest childhood memories was watching snails in our backyard flower garden
I was fascinated by this little creature with a shell, a slimy little tummy, and tiny eyes that turned like periscopes
But what really seemed unusual was how slowly a snail travels
How slow does a snail go
One study clocked a snail at 0.00758 miles per hour, or 40 feet in one hour
No wonder we use the phrase moving at a snail's pace to mean 'slow.'
Although a snail does move at a 'sluggish' pace, one virtue it does possess is perseverance
The great 19th-century preacher Charles Spurgeon wryly observed, 'By perseverance the snail reached the ark.'
According to the apostle Paul, perseverance is a key component in character development
He explained that 'tribulation produces perseverance'
And upon that building block go character and hope
The original Greek word translated 'perseverance'
means 'steadfastness, constancy, and endurance.'
It was used of believers who endured in their walk of faith despite many painful trials
Have setbacks slowed you down to a snail's pace
Be encouraged
God doesn't ask for a fast finish
He expects persevering progress.
Hans Geiger, Marie Curie, Rudolf Diesel, Samuel Morse, and Louis Braille share something in common
They all invented or discovered something significant that bears their name
Their names, along with many others, appear in the 'Encyclopedia Britannica's Greatest Inventions,' a list of '325 innovations that have had profound effects on human life.'
We who follow Christ bear His name
In Luke's record of the early church, he said: 'The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch'
Later, Peter urged the early believers not to be ashamed of suffering as 'a Christian'
The term Christian, once directed at Jesus' followers in scorn, was embraced by them as a badge of honor, a mark of allegiance to Him
E M Blaiklock, former Chair of Classics at the University of Auckland, wrote that in the first century the term Christian had 'a certain appropriateness, for it implied loyalty and acceptance of a person, and that person, the Messiah
The true modern use of the word follows the same tradition
The Christian is one who accepts, with all its implications, the lordship of Jesus Christ.'
As followers of Christ today, we gladly bear His name as our Savior, Lord, and Friend.
I was worrying about a few things as I sat in my car under a shade tree at lunchtime
Then a robin, with a fat worm dangling from its mouth, landed near my door and looked up at me
The robin was a vivid reminder to me of Jesus' words in Matthew 6:25-26, 'Do not worry about your life
Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them
Are you not of more value than they?'
Years ago, in an article in the Denver Seminary magazine Focal Point, Paul Borden gave some helpful suggestions for worriers: Start a worry list
Write down what you're worried about
The bills, Your job, Your children or grandchildren, Your health, The future
Turn your worry list into a prayer list
Ask the Lord to work in those situations you're concerned about
Pray specifically for your needs and depend on Him
Turn your prayer list into an action list
If you have any insight that there's something you can do about your cares, do it
As we turn our worries into prayer and action, Borden says, 'Paralyzing anxiety can be replaced by concern for the responsibilities of life.'
Why not start your list right now?
A South African man surprised nine men robbing his home
Seven of the robbers ran away, but the homeowner managed to shove two into his backyard pool
After realizing that one of the robbers couldn't swim, the homeowner jumped in to save him
The Cape Times reports that once out of the pool, the wet thief called to his friends to come back
Then he pulled a knife and threatened the man who had just rescued him
The homeowner said, 'We were still standing near the pool, and when I saw the knife I just threw him back in
But he was gasping for air and was drowning
So I rescued him again.'
In his letter to the Colossians, the apostle Paul wrote of another rescue:God the Father had saved them from the domain of darkness
This rescue occurred at the death of Christ, but also at the Colossians' conversion
The imagery Paul used suggests that believers have been rescued from the dark reign of Satan by being transferred as free people into the peaceable rule of Christ
By Jesus' death, believers become free citizens in the kingdom of light
The appropriate response to such amazing grace is to show joyous gratitude by offering God acceptable service with reverence and awe .
According to a long-held Christian tradition, the apostle Paul was beheaded and buried in Rome around ad 67
In 2009, scientists conducted carbon dating tests on what many believe to be his remains
While these tests on the bone fragments confirmed that they date from the first or second century, positive identification remains in question
But no matter where Paul's bones rest, his heart lives on through his letters in the New Testament
While imprisoned in Rome, Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in Philippi about his purpose in life
He spoke of his 'earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain'
As we read Paul's words today, they challenge us to examine our own hearts
Are we as passionate as he was about Jesus Christ
Is it our goal to honor Him in our everyday life
Long after we're gone, those who knew us will remember our hearts
May we, like Paul, create a legacy of hope and encouragement centered around Jesus Christ.
Picher, Oklahoma, is no more
In mid-2009, this once-bustling town of 20,000 went out of business
In the first quarter of the 1900s, Picher was a boomtown because of its abundant lead and zinc
Workers extracted the ore, which was used to help arm the US during both World Wars
The town faded as the ore began to run out, but the biggest problem was that while the lead and zinc brought wealth, they also brought pollution
Because nothing was done to deal with the pollution, Picher became a toxic wasteland, and the government condemned the land
What happened to Picher can happen to people
Prosperity can look so good that it's hard to think about possible downsides
Actions that are detrimental to long-term spiritual health are accepted, and unless the problem is corrected, destruction follows
It happened to King Saul
He began as a good king, but in seeking success he failed to see the damage he was doing
Turning his back on God's commands, he acted 'foolishly' and lost his kingdom
In our attempts to find success, we need to watch out for spiritual pollution that comes when we fail to follow God's clear scriptural guidelines
Godly living always beats toxic living.
Have you ever been really thirsty
Years ago, I visited my sister Kathy in Mali, West Africa
During an afternoon of seeing the sights, the temperature had risen far above 100ºF
Parched, I told her, 'Hey, I need something to drink.'
When Kathy told me she had forgotten to bring along a supply of filtered water, I began to get a bit desperate
The longer we drove, the more I wondered what it was like to truly die of thirst
Finally, Kathy said, 'I know where we can go,'as she drove up to the gate of an embassy
Inside I beheld the most beautiful sight, a water cooler
I grabbed one of the tiny paper cups and filled it again and again
My body had been deprived too long and now required lots of liquid to reverse the effects of dehydration
The psalmist compared physical thirst with spiritual thirst: 'As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for You, O God'
His thirst was that of a desperate longing for God, the one and only living God
Do you long for something this world can't provide
This dissatisfaction is a thirst of the soul for God
Run to the One who alone can quench that thirst
'He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with goodness'
A man was filling out a job application when he came to the question 'Have you ever been arrested?'
He wrote, 'No.'
﻿The next question, intended for people who had answered 'Yes'
to the previous question, was 'Why?'
The applicant answered it anyway: 'I never got caught.'
He evidently knew he was guilty of plenty
So was the apostle Paul
He knew he had personally done wrong and sinned against God
He wrote, 'I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man'
He even called himself the 'chief'\s'
of sinners
We too were once separated from the Lord because of our sin and were considered His enemies
But when we confessed our sin and acknowledged our need for His forgiveness, He cleansed us and made us new
Those of us who have known the Lord for many years may have the tendency to forget what we've been rescued from and forgiven of
Sharing about our past and current failures and giving praise to God for forgiveness will help us not to come across as 'holier-than-thou' to people who don't yet know the Lord
The truth is we've all been guilty of plenty, and God deserves the glory for His mercy toward us.
The film Miracle tells the true story of the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team as it marches to an improbable gold medal
At the outset of the story, coach Herb Brooks is shown selecting the players for his team
When he gives assistant coach Craig Patrick a list of names he has chosen, Craig says in surprise, 'You're missing some of the best players.'
Brooks responds, 'I'm not looking for the best players, Craig, just the right ones.'
Brooks knew that individual talent would take the team only so far
A willingness to fit into his style of selfless play would be far more important than talent
Clearly, team success, not individual glory, was the priority
The biblical call to service has a similar emphasis
In God's purposes, each believer does his or her part, but the results are team-oriented
After explaining the wide differences in the spiritual gifts of believers, Paul says, 'the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all'
When we use the skills God gives us, His purposes are accomplished, and He gets the glory
In God's service, it's not about being the best, the most talented, or the most gifted
It's about being the right people, the ones God 'set in the body, joining together to serve the same team.
When the Los Angeles Times covered a 2008 conference championship soccer match between two Christian schools, Azusa Pacific University and Westmont College, it was about far more than winning the game
Three days earlier, a wildfire had swept through the Westmont campus, destroying several academic buildings, faculty homes, and student rooms
Unable to host the game, the rules required Westmont to forfeit
Instead, Azusa invited their opponents to play at their campus where they welcomed Westmont fans with free admission and lunch
On the field, Westmont won an emotional 2-0 victory, while Azusa Pacific won admiration for their good will
LA Times reporter Bill Plaschke wrote: 'Rarely in Southern California sports has there been a better show of sportsmanship than this, 
Azusa Pacific sacrificing its chance at a title defense to give Westmont a fair shot at taking it 
As impressive as the resilience of the conquerors was the kindness of the conquered.'
So often we think only of money when the Bible calls us to give willingly and bountifully, 'for God loves a cheerful giver'
Giving others a chance and offering hospitality to those who hurt is generosity that makes winners of everyone involved.
The buttercups in our backyard were unusually bright and beautiful due to the generous amount of spring rain God sent our way
I wanted to take some pictures of them before they faded, 
but I had trouble getting close enough because they were growing in a very soggy wetland
One sunny afternoon, I pulled on a pair of boots and trudged through briers and brambles toward buttercup bog
Before I got any pictures, I got muddy feet, multiple scratches, and numerous bug bites
But seeing the buttercups made my temporary discomfort worthwhile
Much of life is about 'getting through' the trials and troubles that are inevitable in our sinful world
One of these trials is persecution
The disciples certainly found this to be true
They knew the good things that Jesus has ready for those who follow Him, but they met harsh resistance when they tried to tell others
Those of us who have chosen God's way, and who know from experience that it's 'a more excellent way' , will persevere even when we have to go through danger and difficulty
By doing so, we show others a beautiful picture of God's peace, mercy, and forgiveness
The joy that awaits will make our temporary discomfort worthwhile.
In a commentary on Ecclesiastes 9:15, Martin Luther cites the story of Themistocles, the soldier and statesman who commanded the Athenian squadron
Through his strategy, he won the Battle of Salamis, drove the Persian army from Greek soil, and saved his city
A few years later, he fell out of favor, was ostracized by his countrymen, and was banished from Athens
Thus, Luther concludes, 'Themistocles did much good for his city, but received much ingratitude.'
The crowd, for some reason, seems to ignore or quickly forget the good that the poor and humble man accomplishes through his wisdom
No matter 'Wisdom is [still] better than strength' even if 'the poor man's wisdom is despised'
It's better to be a quiet, honest sage who, though forgotten, leaves much good behind, than a swaggering, strident fool who, though many applaud him, 'destroys much good'
Accordingly, what matters in the end is not the recognition and gratitude we receive for the work we've done, but the souls of those gentle folk in whom we've sown the seeds of righteousness
Put another way: 'Wisdom is justified by all her children'
Whom have you influenced through your wise and godly wisdom?
Last spring the window to one of the rooms in our house was repeatedly attacked by a robin
The bird would perch at the base of the window, ruffle its feathers, chirp loudly, and then fly headfirst into the glass
I did some research and learned that robins are territorial
While nesting, they drive out any competing robins
This bird apparently saw its reflection in our window and thought it was another robin
The threat was not real; it was only an illusion
In the Old Testament, we see an instance when Jacob imagined a threat that wasn't really there
Years earlier, Jacob had stolen his brother Esau's blessing by their father
Now, after many years of separation, they were going to meet again
Jacob thought Esau would harm him, so he sent gifts ahead as a peace offering of sorts
Then, when he saw Esau approaching with 400 men, Jacob panicked
Yet what Jacob thought was an attack force turned out to be a welcoming committee
'Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept'
In interpersonal relationships, we sometimes misinterpret a situation
We must ask the Lord for discernment so we don't miss a friendship because of an imaginary threat.
In the US, more long distance calls are made on Mother's Day than any other day
But on Father's Day, the most collect calls are made
It seems that children still depend on their fathers to provide, even when they are far away from home
Fathers are needed and wanted for much more than financial help
While 1 Thessalonians 2:10-12 is primarily directed toward church leaders, Paul talks about how their role is similar to a father's
He states: 'You know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children.'
Exhorted is 'to call near.'
It is easy for fathers to think that all that's required of them is to bring home a paycheck
But children need their close encouragement
The word comforted is 'to console.'
Nothing is more valuable to a child than the time given by a father to listen and talk
Without constant relating, relationships turn cold
Charged is 'to affirm.'
Fathers challenge their children by affirming the truth of God's Word as they live it out in front of them
And even in failings, they affirm what is right through the asking of forgiveness
How thankful we can be for fathers who help their children 'walk worthy of God'
On October 19, 2008, I heard the news that Levi Stubbs, lead singer for Motown's vocal group The Four Tops, had died at age 72
As a boy, I enjoyed the Four Tops, especially Stubbs' emotion-filled, passionate voice
I had never met him or heard the group in concert, 
yet his passing affected me at an unexpected level
Behind my sadness, I think, was the reminder that I too am getting older
The death of someone I listened to when I was young reminded me that time isn't marching on, it's running out
In the only psalm attributed to Moses, he wrote, 'The days of our lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years, yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away'
Those aren't words we want to hear
We want to remain forever young, 
but Scripture reminds us that the years pass and death will one day arrive
That leaves us to wrestle with two essential questions: Am I ready to 'fly away' at life's end, having trusted Christ as my Savior
And am I using my fleeting days to please the One who loves me eternally
How are you doing, no matter what your age, with the challenges raised by the brevity of life?
During the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, a widow lost a third of her income when her bank stocks no longer paid dividends after her trusted bank failed
The Wall Street Journal quoted her tearful response as an example of the feelings of many people who were similarly affected: 'You just think, '\sThis can't be happening.' What is secure anymore?'
Tragedy and hard times always jolt our thinking
Our best plans and hopes can be shattered by events beyond our control
We are reminded that there is only one source of true security in a changing world
With new appreciation, we consider Paul's words: 'Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy
Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life'
When our resources diminish, we can grow richer in good works, generosity, and sharing with others
If financial stability returns, we can hold more loosely what we are given, trusting solely in God
We are secure in Him alone.
Jesus taught that the world seen from God's viewpoint is tilted in favor of the oppressed
This teaching emerges in the Sermon on the Mount and other statements of Jesus: the first will be last , and he who humbles himself will be exalted
But why would God single out the oppressed for special attention
1 Suffering helps us realize our urgent need for redemption
2 Suffering helps us experience our dependence on God and our interdependence with one another
3 Suffering helps us distinguish between necessities and luxuries
4 Suffering helps us respond to the call of the gospel because we may have become so desperate that we cry out to God
The poor, the hungry, the mourners, and those who suffer are blessed because their lack of self-sufficiency is obvious to them every day
They must turn somewhere for strength
People who are rich, successful, and beautiful may go through life relying on their natural gifts
But people who are needy, dependent, and dissatisfied with life are more likely to welcome God's free gift of love
'Blessed are the poor in spirit.'
Why
Because 'theirs is the kingdom of heaven'
It was just a speck, a tiny foreign object flying through the air on a windy day while I was cutting the grass
Somehow that speck made its way into my left eye
For the next few hours that little speck caused quite a bit of irritation
I tried washing it out
My wife, Sue, a nurse, tried everything she could think of
Finally, we went to a Med Center, 
where the medical personnel on duty couldn't get it out either
Only after applying some ointment and waiting several more annoying hours did I get relief from the speck
This tiny, nagging irritant made me think anew about Jesus' teaching in Matthew 7 about criticizing others
My first thought was to be impressed with the practicality of Jesus' illustration
Using the effective literary tool of hyperbole, or exaggeration, He explained for His listeners how foolish it is for a person to criticize someone without seeing that he or she is also guilty of error
If you can find someone else's little speck while ignoring the hunk of wood in your own eye, something's wrong
It should be unthinkable to ignore our own faults while pointing out someone else's
An attitude of self-righteousness has no place in the Christian life
That should be plain to see.
In the spring of 2009, Susan Boyle took the stage of Britain's Got Talent
Compared to the other contestants, she was plain-looking
No one expected much when she raised the microphone to her lips
But then she began to sing
Spellbound, the judges were clearly taken with the beauty and power of the voice that filled the auditorium as the audience stood to their feet cheering with delight
All were surprised that such a rivetingly beautiful song came from such an unlikely source
All of us can be unlikely sources when it comes to the beauty of Jesus flowing out of us
But that is how He planned it
Common folk like you and me take turns on the stage of life in front of the world's skeptical audience so that our friends, family, and all who fill the arena of our lives will see and hear the love and grace of Jesus Christ emerging from our lives
I love Peter's reminder that we are 'a people for His own possession, that [we] may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous light'
You might think you're an unlikely source, but when you allow the Lord to flow through you, the watching world will stand up and take notice.
People tend to remember negative images more than they do positive ones, according to an experiment conducted at the University of Chicago
While people claim that they want to turn away from the barrage of bad news in the media, reports on tragedies, diseases, economic downturns, this study suggests that their minds are drawn to the stories
Catherine Hankey was more interested in the 'good news.'
She had a great desire to see young women come to know Christ
In 1866, she became very ill
As she lay in bed, she thought about all those with whom she had shared the story of Jesus' redemption, and she wished that someone would visit and comfort her with 'the old, old story.'
That's when she wrote the poem that later became a hymn, 'Tell Me the Old, Old Story'?
Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in,   That wonderful redemption, God's remedy for sin
Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon;  The early dew of morning has passed away at noon
We never tire of hearing the story that because of His great love God sent His one and only Son to this earth
He lived a perfect life, took our sin upon Himself when He was crucified, and 3 days later rose again
When we receive Him as our Savior, we are given eternal life and become His children
Tell someone the old, old story of Jesus and His love
They need some good news.
In the award-winning film Chariots of Fire, one of the characters is legendary British sprinter Harold Abrahams
He is obsessed with winning, 
but in a preliminary 100-meter dash leading up to the 1924 Olympics, he is soundly beaten by his rival, Eric Liddell
Abrahams' response is deep despair
When his girlfriend, Sybil, tries to encourage him, Harold angrily declares, 'I run to win
If I can't win, I won't run!'
Sybil responds wisely, 'If you don't run, you can't win.'
Life is full of reversals, and we as Christians are not excluded from disappointments that make us want to give up
But in the race that is the Christian life, Paul challenges us to keep running
He told the Corinthians, 'Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize
Run in such a way that you may obtain it'
We are to run faithfully, Paul is saying, spurred on by the knowledge that we run to honor our King and to receive from Him an eternal crown
If we falter in our running, if we quit serving God or give in to sin because of our difficulties, we risk losing a rich reward we could have received had we run our best
Sybil was right
'If you don't run, you can't win.'?
This idea of being careful with language is important in Bible study as well
Paul described this process as 'rightly dividing the Word of truth'
The phrase translated 'rightly dividing'
was used of a skilled craftsman cutting something straight
In the context of Bible study, it means taking the time for diligent and careful study, while prayerfully asking for the Holy Spirit's guidance
It means teaching the truth directly and correctly
Accurately discerning and passing on God's truth must be the priority of every conscientious believer.
